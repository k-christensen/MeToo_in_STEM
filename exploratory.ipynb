       " ' It is really hard to choose one particular moment, as my PhD was a nightmare almost every day for 5 years due to constant threats and uncivil behavior from my supervisor. I should point out that I was never a victim of sexual harassment – I was a victim of Harassment the demeaning attitude, aggressive pressure and insidious intimidation that arise from the abuse of power over others.Perhaps one of the most memorable moments (many of which I unconsciously repressed) happened shortly after I started my PhD. I had been working for several days structuring a figure panel on an extremely non-intuitive program I had never heard of and that I had to learn all by myself. My supervisor demanded that all results were shown to him on that particular format on a weekly basis and that day had arrived. After looking at my work with contempt, he printed the file, ripped the paper in front of my eyes and said “This? This is crap”. After that, he tossed the paper pieces to the trash bin violently, as if I had done the worst thing in the world. What came next was a conversation (more of a monologue, really) on how I should change my behavior, otherwise I would be replaced by one of the hundreds of students who would abide by his rules and appreciate the opportunity of working under him. He also mentioned (displaying his fingers very close to my face) that I was “this close” – to what I didn’t understand, but I assumed he was talking about me being kicked out of his lab. His threats were always present throughout my PhD, and I became the “little mouse who freezes in the corner of the cage”, always trying to keep away from conflict situations.Every day before our scheduled weekly meetings (or the spontaneous ones) I would feel sick. My constant state of anxiety and fear led to panic attacks and by the end, while writing my thesis, it culminated in me having to spend a week in a hospital bed. When I returned to the lab, he told me my thesis was bad but that we should stop trying to improve it because I was weak and couldn’t handle the pressure.I presented several formal complaints along the years to my thesis committee, to the direction of the institute and to other PIs who knew very well my supervisor’s reputation and all the other careers he ruined. As he is one of the few people with a permanent contract with the institute and a powerful position, the answer was always the same “you were warned; there is nothing we can do about it. It was your responsibility.” I’ve learned during my PhD that nothing protects a student from unscrupulous supervisors, fearful thesis committees and complacent direction board members.',\n",
       " ' I have given up on fighting for a career as a scientist. At a certain point during my PhD, my work was about to be submitted to a prestigious journal. For some reason, my supervisor decided he didn’t want to publish it. Instead, what was supposed to be my only first author publication ended up on a drawer and it will never be published, which lowers a lot my chances of pursuing a career in science – even if I really wanted one. Even though I never asked for any recommendation from him for any of the jobs I took after my PhD, he takes every opportunity to actively sabotage my career progression.',\n",
       " ' I’m afraid to put myself in a position that would make me vulnerable again to the abuse I’ve suffered during my PhD.',\n",
       " ' My dream career – the one I’ve been fighting for all my adult life. It has also cost me the opportunity to collaborate, to go to scientific conferences, to publish and the chance to have built a good CV. It has cost me my physical and mental health, which years later I am still trying to recover. In monetary terms, it has cost me two months working on my thesis without a salary. After 10 years working in academia, I find myself without publications, a career in science or savings in a bank account.',\n",
       " ' I am a people person, an extrovert, someone who needs human interaction to feel fulfilled. I believe in cooperation and teamwork as much as I believe tolerance and kindness are key for interpersonal dynamics.Being a lover of the horror genre has helped me cope with anxiety and fear in real life.',\n",
       " ' The bright side of having been pushed out of academia is to have found my vocation in Education and a job I love. Every day I get to think about what me, my colleagues and close friends have been through under the tyranny of the academic system and to come up with ideas on how to transform the academic environment into a richer and more pleasant one. I have converted my personal frustrations into energy that propels me to find ways to fight for respect and dignity and against harassment and abuse. I also get to meet and talk to a lot of brilliant scientists and future scientists, and to those I dedicate my efforts to change the academic system for the better.',\n",

       "'My Worst Moment Running down four flights of stairs in the nearly empty Math building, tripping and falling as I stumbled outside, feeling sick to my stomach as I questioned if I\\'d \"overreacted\" to my 60+ year-old professor\\'s advancements. I Have Given Up On  Math. I loved it, I was passionate about it, I wanted to study nothing else. But I couldn\\'t be in the classroom with HIM, and it destroyed my math career. I\\'m Afraid  I overreacted. I under reacted. I misunderstood. I took it out of context. I should have reported it - did others suffer because I didn\\'t? What was the real harm anyway? He never touched me - so why, 29 years later, do I still feel dirty and nauseous when I think about that night? This Has Cost Me  $200,000 in lost wages/opportunity. $50,000 in therapy (largely covered by my insurance). $85,000 in related psychological treatment worsened by my trauma. Something You Should Know About Me  I survived, and now am a talented, caring accounting professor who defends my students and my children from any sort of unwelcome advances or harassment. Is There a Bright Side?  Pink - You and UR Hand [YouTube link]\\n\\n\\n\\n My Fight Song  I listened to my gut and got out before he touched me. I\\'m incredibly proud of myself for that.

       " 'worst moment i haven’t been sexually harassed or assaulted. i’m writing out of guilt for not doing more to stop a situation before it happened to someone else.the harasser was a graduate student in the same lab as me (i’m also a graduate student). he was a jerk for a long time before his behavior rose to the level of harassment. for example, he routinely sent long rambling emails criticizing junior female colleagues. he sent an email to the entire department after mandatory sexual harassment training saying it was “interesting” but maybe there were cultural differences that meant we should actually be ok with some of the behaviors the training called “harassment.”english wasn’t his first language so in these situations most of us gave him the benefit of the doubt, hoping we were misinterpreting what he was trying to say. one email included lyrics from a song which weren’t threatening, but the song was about someone going to school with a gun and shooting himself. a number of people reported it to hr. the email came late at night and i was glad i had to be away from campus the next day.this grad student published a lot and was close to our pi. the one time another grad student and i tried to talk to our pi about his behavior, our pi defended him by saying he’d had a difficult life. i never reported him to hr (and after a presentation by our school’s title ix officer focused on “win-win solutions,” i’m unlikely to bother with that route). he’d been furious at me for not asking how he was in an email once, so what would he do if he found out i’d made real trouble? i didn’t actually fear he’d be physically violent, but i was confident our pi would side with him in any dispute between us. i also thought maybe i was just being too sensitive (since then i’ve talked with other graduate students in our department; it wasn’t just me).the sexual harassment happened when he was supervising a younger researcher. i found out months after the fact that he expressed romantic interest in her that she did not reciprocate. in response, he reminded her our pi would believe whatever he said about the quality of her work in the lab (she was doing excellent work; the implication was that he would lie and say she wasn’t). it was a clear case of quid-pro-quo go out with me or their will be professional consequences.fortunately our pi believed her when she told him about the threat. unfortunately our pi kept the harasser in the lab until he graduated the next academic year. he‘s now doing a postdoc in europe.i haven’t reported this because our pi already knows about it, and i think the only person who might be harmed would be the woman who was harassed, who’s still pursuing a career in this field. i’m mad at myself. i wonder whether facing consequences for his less severe behaviors would have taught him to treat his trainee appropriately. i have given up on universities caring about anything other than their public image and the alumni dollars it brings. i’m afraid people in power will never really change things. this has cost me i’m ok. i do wonder what the young women in my department could have accomplished, in our research and our personal lives, with the time and energy we’ve been using to help each other deal with assholes. something you should know i naturally have a lot of compassion for other people and tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, even if we don’t get along. in hindsight, i think this is a huge reason why i didn’t report or do more to stop our lab’s harasser. i really bought into his claims that *he* was the real victim in these situations. is there a bright side things are changing. our department actually got rid of a sexual harasser last year. (different person than the one described above. the person who left was support staff, not an academic researcher, and sadly i think that’s the only reason he’s gone.) newer faculty members are much aware of these issues and receptive to what we have to say, and nearly all the grad students in our department are great people who are truly supportive of each other. i’m hopeful about the next generation of leaders. my fight song truth hurts by lizzo secret weapon my patience and my anger.',\n",

this is crap”. after that, he tossed the paper pieces to the trash bin violently, as if i had done the worst thing in the world. what came next was a conversation (more of a monologue, really) on how i should change my behavior, otherwise i would be replaced by one of the hundreds of students who would abide by his rules and appreciate the opportunity of working under him. he also mentioned (displaying his fingers very close to my face) that i was “this close” – to what i didn’t understand, but i assumed he was talking about me being kicked out of his lab. his threats were always present throughout my phd, and i became the “little mouse who freezes in the corner of the cage”, always trying to keep away from conflict situations.every day before our scheduled weekly meetings (or the spontaneous ones) i would feel sick. my constant state of anxiety and fear led to panic attacks and by the end, while writing my thesis, it culminated in me having to spend a week in a hospital bed. when i returned to the lab, he told me my thesis was bad but that we should stop trying to improve it because i was weak and couldn’t handle the pressure.i presented several formal complaints along the years to my thesis committee, to the direction of the institute and to other pis who knew very well my supervisor’s reputation and all the other careers he ruined. as he is one of the few people with a permanent contract with the institute and a powerful position, the answer was always the same “you were warned; there is nothing we can do about it. it was your responsibility.” i’ve learned during my phd that nothing protects a student from unscrupulous supervisors, fearful thesis committees and complacent direction board members. i have given up on i have given up on fighting for a career as a scientist. at a certain point during my phd, my work was about to be submitted to a prestigious journal. for some reason, my supervisor decided he didn’t want to publish it. instead, what was supposed to be my only first author publication ended up on a drawer and it will never be published, which lowers a lot my chances of pursuing a career in science – even if i really wanted one. even though i never asked for any recommendation from him for any of the jobs i took after my phd, he takes every opportunity to actively sabotage my career progression. i’m afraid i’m afraid to put myself in a position that would make me vulnerable again to the abuse i’ve suffered during my phd. this has cost me my dream career – the one i’ve been fighting for all my adult life. it has also cost me the opportunity to collaborate, to go to scientific conferences, to publish and the chance to have built a good cv. it has cost me my physical and mental health, which years later i am still trying to recover. in monetary terms, it has cost me two months working on my thesis without a salary. after 10 years working in academia, i find myself without publications, a career in science or savings in a bank account. something you should know i am a people person, an extrovert, someone who needs human interaction to feel fulfilled. i believe in cooperation and teamwork as much as i believe tolerance and kindness are key for interpersonal dynamics.being a lover of the horror genre has helped me cope with anxiety and fear in real life. is there a bright side the bright side of having been pushed out of academia is to have found my vocation in education and a job i love. every day i get to think about what me, my colleagues and close friends have been through under the tyranny of the academic system and to come up with ideas on how to transform the academic environment into a richer and more pleasant one. i have converted my personal frustrations into energy that propels me to find ways to fight for respect and dignity and against harassment and abuse. i also get to meet and talk to a lot of brilliant scientists and future scientists, and to those i dedicate my efforts to change the academic system for the better. my fight songs secret weapon everyone tells me that i look austere and serious. to be honest, that is an outside armor i use to protect myself.',\n",
       " 'my worst moment i was a phd student in science, and i had been invited to participate in a summer school, where dozens of bright young minds would gather to network and to get a crash course in our field.it all happened at once at the end. one of the organizers, a professor in the field at a top institution, invited a friend of his (unrelated to the school) to join us onsite. the friend hounded us, especially focusing on recent comments made by another scientist about how women cannot be in the lab because they cry and fall in love with their mentors. he kept pushing the point, even getting in the hot tub with many of the students (male and female, all easily 20-25 years his junior). i and a few other women ended up having to leave, pushing us out of what should have been a useful networking opportunity.later that evening both of the men showed up on the porch where we were drinking and joined us. the professor offered to open up the “exclusive” bar onsite…because he didn’t think we were imbibing enough? then his friend started giving unwarranted and undesired massages (shoulders and *legs*) to all of the women, working his way down the couch. he didn’t reach me because of two people1) a woman at the event who was about to get (or had just gotten) married and announced that she didn’t feel threatened by him, making herself a target by choice.2) a man who was sitting next to me helped me out of beig cornered and took me to the other side of the patio. i have given up on 1) the school took place off campus, and the students were from all over the country. i don’t even know where to begin to report, especially considering…2) for the longest time i didn’t believe it was bad enough to report. it was just a couple creeps being creepy. i wasn’t assaulted, i wasn’t attacked, and i haven’t seen this professor again. i still struggle to submit this story because the other stories i know about are “worse”. i’m afraid trusting male professors in social settings. i now check every conference i go to making sure that the professor won’t be there. is there a bright side that my job search will be hampered because this professor will be on the hiring committee. i don’t even know if he remembers what he did. that is why i am scared of submitting a photo or using my name. i’m also terrified that by not reporting i have enabled this professor to continue harassing young women. my fight songs the man who pulled me out of the line is now my boyfriend. he is an ally, and has continued to support me through grad school.also i met some fantastic women at the school, who i believe i am closer to through this shared experience. we all have stories beyond this one night, and we’ve tried to keep each other safe and sane.',\n",
       " 'my worst moments there are four top ones that come to mind (limiting the scope to stem employment only, but these experiences could easily happen anywhere), at three different employers i’ve given up on my new colleague, an engineer, married with a daughter my age, one day while working late alone in the office snuck up behind me, grabbed me by the hair, licked the back of my neck and swirled his tongue in my ear. when i fought him and yelled to get off me, he looked annoyed and said, “what’s wrong with you? can’t you take a joke?”. i told my manager the next day. he said, “that sounds like an hr problem.” hr told me, “why don’t just try to get along with people, ok?”. they never even spoke to the engineer. my contract was almost up and i left without asking for renewal. i’m afraid in a staff meeting, my co-worker said he’d told me about a scheduling change, but i hadn’t been notified. i asked him to repeat the information, he said he shouldn’t have to since i was already told. i insisted i don’t know, let’s discuss it now, and he told me we need to speak in private immediately so we left the meeting to go to a private room. as soon as the door was closed, he exploded in anger screaming about how could i embarrass him in the meeting like that! he punched me in the face. a month later, a different co-worker karate kicked me in the neck when i tried to give him a mop and told him to clean the floor after he deliberately poured a cup of tea out on the floor of my office. the employer told me in both instances, “it’s your fault that he was angry. you should just apologize.” i said no. i got fired. this has cost me the new manager in our first one on one meeting, my new manager told me he, “can’t stand the look of my stupid face.” he also accused me of lying about my qualifications. when i told him i was ending our meeting because of his unprofessionalism and his comments were uncalled for, he responded that he’d never said those things, i’m a liar and i’m attacking him. when i told my director, he replied, “he never talks to me like that, are you sure that really happened? you probably just misunderstood.” in that one moment i lost all my credibility for the next four years until that manager left. he purposefully made my life hell for four years. the answer to every difficult question i asked him was either, “why are you so emotional today?” or, “you’ll never understand the answer anyway so i’m not going to bother wasting my time telling you.” or “what you don’t understand is…”. i ended up with less important assignments and was disenfranchised from participating in meetings and major projects, which ultimately stagnated my career. something you should know about me the manager described above made a misogynistic joke about me specifically and i called him out on it on the spot. he filed an official complaint about me in retaliation for not laughing at his joke. our director was brought in to mediate. the manager explained that he was just yelling stuff at random, he doesn’t know what the words he said even mean, and he doesn’t have control over what comes out of his mouth anyway, so it’s not fair to hold him accountable for what he says and does. everyone else should learn to work around it because it’s not possible for him to change. i insisted he can and should do better, but the director bought his story. the director told me, “men are up here, women are down here, that’s the way it is. that’s the way it is at (this company) and that’s the way it is at (our department). that will never change. you must accept this.” he told me that i need to accept my subordinate role, put up and shut up, or leave. if i have the audacity to complain to hr, don’t bother, just leave. i decided i don’t accept, but was picky about what job i should take next. both the manager and director left shortly afterwards so i’m glad i stuck this one out. is there a bright side competing for leadership and management roles in my career. i don’t get taken seriously no matter what i do. i realize i either work for myself, or market myself as a high level independent contributor. i’ve given up on the idea that human resources is for the benefit of employees and can help resolve employee disagreements. hr is there to serve to best interest of the company, and usually that means getting rid of complainers. i gave up on pursuing more education. i’ve been told by several people over the years, “if you get too much education, you’ll never find a good husband.” fight song i get a lot less support from other women than i think there should be, like competition for the attention of a male manager. whatever nonsense i reject to preserve my dignity, there’s always someone who’s happy to accept it in order to get ahead. i don’t want to sink to that level, but my resistance to take part makes me look like the uncooperative one who’s causing a problem, where my intention is actually to raise the level of professionalism. secret weapon i’ve ended up unemployed and even homeless to avoid harassment and assaults from particular coworkers. bouncing from one job to another to escape bad situations rather than moving towards something i want looks bad on a resume. it became difficult to find new employment and to get meaningful references. constantly changing employers means starting on the bottom rung of the ladder over and over with little chance to build a professional reputation.',\n",
       " 'my worst moment in my first scientist job out of graduate school my supervisor became violent, he would push me off sidewalks and down stairs, throw me into walls, grab my arm and squeeze it until i brusied and hit me. he would corner me in the office and say “you really need to learn how to get out of having your back to the wall”. when i’d walk to my car in the evening he would follow me into the parking garage, and pick me up and slap me despite my screaming for him to put me down. one evening he followed me into the kitchen pushed me up against the counter and bent me backwards i was terrified he was going to rape me. i pleaded with him to let me go and he finally did. he told me that he could destroy me professionally if i told anyone and the only one i needed to keep happy was him because he would be writing my performance reviews and giving my recommendations. i stopped eating, stopped talking to friends and family and became completely isolated. i have given up on any hope for a future for me as a scientist. i felt embarrassed, humiliated and ashamed. i’m afraid that the same thing will happen to other young female scientists. that i won’t respond differently if the same scenario presented itself again. this has cost me mental health conseling, i had to move because he knew where i lived. i wasn’t forced to quit my job but the trauma associated with the workplace led me to quit. something you should know about me these experiences profoundly changed how i approached science and my role within it. people outside of our profession have no idea how much of our heart we pour into our work i felt like my world was upside down. is there a bright side in retrospect the experience made me a more resilient and more empathic person and motivated me to be purposeful and intentional with my time to use it to serve others. my field is still male dominated and the healing from the experience equipped me with good skills for working with men. my fight song the fear by the score [youtube link] secret weapon crossfit, powerlifting, and running. while exercise does not replace mental health therapy it is an excellent supplement.',\n",

       " 'to the attending who harassed me i’m sorry that we are in this position and thank you for meeting. i know that you met with hr already. i was told that you were “sufficiently remorseful they felt you wouldn’t do it again.” i’m sure you are sorry. however, what concerns me more is whether you understand what you did and why it’s not acceptable. the whole process of experiencing this and reporting it has made it to clear to me that even at a place like here so many people do not understand sexual harassment. i would like to share my perspective on this because this is the voice and perspective that is so often silenced via everything from violent retaliation to career hits and stigma.female physicians already have to rally every day for equal recognition in our jobs. when you repeatedly touched my leg and kissed me, you sent a signal that i’m not your colleague but something inferior. i am certain you would never grab a male resident kiss him. i am also certain you would not have kissed another attending demonstrating how these actions play on both the gender and attending-trainee power dynamics. those dynamics alone make these actions wrong. i was left feeling like some small play thing not the resident who was supposed to be the leader of the team. it was humiliating and belittling. it is one thing to hope for this from patients but it’s disheartening to have to hope for that equality in recognition from an established faculty member.even more fundamentally, your actions demonstrate a lack of respect for a woman’s autonomy given that it didn’t cross your mind that a woman might not perceive your actions with her body in the same way as you. my thigh is not available for your grabbing at will and my face nor any other resident’s is not available for your lips to do what you want.i want to be very clear; there is no construct of endearment, affection, or empathy, as has been suggested, that describes what you did. it was sexual harassment.and ultimately, there is how it left me feeling. maybe why i pushed so hard for something to be done before you went back on service, is the enormous effect your actions had on me and my fear they may do the same to someone else. sure, the frequent thigh grab was certainly uncomfortable. however, when you kissed me-it was a visceral feeling of sheer fear. and when you kept holding onto me after you kissed me and kept talking in my face, my mind was racing through what you were going to do next or what exactly was happening as i gritted my teeth and smiled back at you. this was followed by constant anxiety, frequent panic attacks, flashbacks and sleepless nights in tears over the next few hours, days, and weeks. your actions also opened old wounds i realized i never let heal. it wasn’t until this happened that i ever told anyone the full extent of the past. at first it was traumatizing but i’m learning to derive strength from having survived it. the last person who kissed me without consent then violently assaulted and tried to rape me. that is the fear your actions evoked; emotions of having your dignity and safety stripped away all at once. there is a key distinction between those events and these – he was a grad student without any power over me and i could eventually fight him back. you are in a position of power relative to residents and i never felt that i could ask you to stop grabbing my thigh or not kiss me. knowing someone’s past shouldn’t matter in deciding these actions were wrong. but i want you to realize that you never know what someone has been through nor do you need to. these two experiences have also shown me these behaviors are not reserved for just bars or drunk frat parties; academic institutions are not immune to this behavior.i am sure going to hr was not comfortable for you. what you may not realize is how hard i had to work to even get this to hr. sexual harassment and assault in many ways are a dual trauma-the pain of experiencing it and the re-traumatization of re-telling the story only to feel degraded, and alone over and over again. it took 6 meetings and phone calls on my end for a plan to be put in place. part of me regrets having reported it at all. i used to love our residency and my job but now i’ve lost so much trust of the established faculty because of what you did, because initially reporting this left me feeling even more isolated, and because here is where i was reminded of the worst night of my life. i’m sure being reminded of the past was something that was bound to happen. however, i hate that it happened here. for a while it took all my energy to show up here and keep from emotionally falling apart at work and i’m sure it will be a long journey pulling it back together.this may all seem hyperbolic in response to what really amounts to a few minutes of your actions. but it only takes a few seconds to minutes to harass or assault someone. that is how much power one has in this sphere-a few seconds to minutes of your action can cause significantly more pain. i don’t share all of this to chastise you and i am really sorry we are in this position. i share it because it’s a perspective that needs to be shared and i hope brings you greater understanding of this problem. i have given up on not yet. i’m afraid of damage to my reputation, repercussions from leadership and the attending i reported, of being further violated by people in positions of power or from people i thought i could trust, of the flashbacks and anxiety i face at work constantly. this has cost me an enormous amount of time in meetings, time spent dealing with my own emotions, money for therapy. is there a bright side i think reporting this has awoken people at my institution that is an issue that needs to be dealt with and understood better.',\n",

       " 'my worst moment the first conference i attended as a grad student was held on a university campus. i arrived a little early, checked in for registration and headed over to the student union bar to see if anyone else for the meeting was congregating there. it wasn’t very busy at all and i was standing in a quiet corner wondering if to get a drink or leave when an older guy drinking a beer came over to me introducing himself as a professor from that university and asked if i was there for the meeting. i told him that i was and started to introduce myself. i have given up on “perhaps you’re not as horny as i am yet” and immediately pushed his hand against my stomach and down inside the front of my jeans and inside my underwear. i don’t know why i didn’t cry out, but i didn’t. instead, i wrenched away in horror and ran to the ladies bathrooms, acting purely on instinct. i’m afraid t being ok to be in a room alone with men that i don’t know really well. even though i now lead my own lab and have to attend many meetings with students, other professors, new colleagues etc. and have therefore been in the situation hundreds and hundreds of time, i still feel my heart rate go up and have difficulty concentrating if i can’t see a clear exit route. this has cost me that i will always feel so incredibly stupid for having such a long and ongoing negative reaction to an encounter that probably that lasted for less than two minutes in total and was in a fairly public place. it took me a really, really long time to accept that i didn’t do this (this life of fear and anxiety) to myself and, in dark moments, i still don’t really believe that. something you should know about me thousands in fees for private counseling. but i don’t resent those costs as much as i do the difficult-to-monetize opportunities i missed by avoiding events and situations when i knew i might feel threatened or may see this person again. i switched fields and this, together with my insecurities and anxieties, meant that i missed several opportunities that led to my career advancement lagging significantly, maybe 8 or 9 years, behind my peers. i eventually got myself together but, on starting my lab, i found that i was ineligible for several fellowships and grants that many people establish themselves with because i was too many years post-phd. unlike having had time-out to raise kids, i cannot explain in 250 words or less why this is or why i might deserve an exception. is there a bright side? i’m also not white. despite this single event being awful, it never made me think i should quit science. i know that most people in the community would never condone the awful actions of that individual. the moments that i think about quitting are always inspired by incessant low-level racist comments and statements of privilege and superiority by a surprising proportion of people. these make me wonder if our community is really as educated, evidence-driven and enlightened as it claims to be and if i really want to be a part of it. my fight song i’m ok with myself and who i am as a person! sure, i suffer from situation-triggered anxiety, but i’m kind and considerate to everyone at every level. i don’t claim credit when it belongs to someone else, i don’t steal other people’s ideas and i don’t bully or belittle students or anyone else. no matter how i’ve been treated, or how often i see others behaving in this way, i have not compromised on that. having made the decision to maintain my personal integrity, even if it means forfeiting a few scientific ‘wins’, makes me feel calmer and stronger. even if i don’t make tenure, or don’t keep achieve a lifetime career in science, at least i didn’t make moral compromises that i would live to regret. abusers, racists and bullies might gain some progress and a little power from their actions but, no matter what else they do, they will never be anything more than those labels. one day their behaviour will be known and rejected. as mlk said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice … and i have nothing to fear from it.']"

       " 'worst moment it is really hard to choose one particular moment, as my phd was a nightmare almost every day for 5 years due to constant threats and uncivil behavior from my supervisor. i should point out that i was never a victim of sexual harassment – i was a victim of harassment the demeaning attitude, aggressive pressure and insidious intimidation that arise from the abuse of power over others.perhaps one of the most memorable moments (many of which i unconsciously repressed) happened shortly after i started my phd. i had been working for several days structuring a figure panel on an extremely non-intuitive program i had never heard of and that i had to learn all by myself. my supervisor demanded that all results were shown to him on that particular format on a weekly basis and that day had arrived. after looking at my work with contempt, he printed the file, ripped the paper in front of my eyes and said “this? this is crap”. after that, he tossed the paper pieces to the trash bin violently, as if i had done the worst thing in the world. what came next was a conversation (more of a monologue, really) on how i should change my behavior, otherwise i would be replaced by one of the hundreds of students who would abide by his rules and appreciate the opportunity of working under him. he also mentioned (displaying his fingers very close to my face) that i was “this close” – to what i didn’t understand, but i assumed he was talking about me being kicked out of his lab. his threats were always present throughout my phd, and i became the “little mouse who freezes in the corner of the cage”, always trying to keep away from conflict situations.every day before our scheduled weekly meetings (or the spontaneous ones) i would feel sick. my constant state of anxiety and fear led to panic attacks and by the end, while writing my thesis, it culminated in me having to spend a week in a hospital bed. when i returned to the lab, he told me my thesis was bad but that we should stop trying to improve it because i was weak and couldn’t handle the pressure.i presented several formal complaints along the years to my thesis committee, to the direction of the institute and to other pis who knew very well my supervisor’s reputation and all the other careers he ruined. as he is one of the few people with a permanent contract with the institute and a powerful position, the answer was always the same “you were warned; there is nothing we can do about it. it was your responsibility.” i’ve learned during my phd that nothing protects a student from unscrupulous supervisors, fearful thesis committees and complacent direction board members. i have given up on i have given up on fighting for a career as a scientist. at a certain point during my phd, my work was about to be submitted to a prestigious journal. for some reason, my supervisor decided he didn’t want to publish it. instead, what was supposed to be my only first author publication ended up on a drawer and it will never be published, which lowers a lot my chances of pursuing a career in science – even if i really wanted one. even though i never asked for any recommendation from him for any of the jobs i took after my phd, he takes every opportunity to actively sabotage my career progression. i’m afraid i’m afraid to put myself in a position that would make me vulnerable again to the abuse i’ve suffered during my phd. this has cost me my dream career – the one i’ve been fighting for all my adult life. it has also cost me the opportunity to collaborate, to go to scientific conferences, to publish and the chance to have built a good cv. it has cost me my physical and mental health, which years later i am still trying to recover. in monetary terms, it has cost me two months working on my thesis without a salary. after 10 years working in academia, i find myself without publications, a career in science or savings in a bank account. something you should know i am a people person, an extrovert, someone who needs human interaction to feel fulfilled. i believe in cooperation and teamwork as much as i believe tolerance and kindness are key for interpersonal dynamics.being a lover of the horror genre has helped me cope with anxiety and fear in real life. is there a bright side the bright side of having been pushed out of academia is to have found my vocation in education and a job i love. every day i get to think about what me, my colleagues and close friends have been through under the tyranny of the academic system and to come up with ideas on how to transform the academic environment into a richer and more pleasant one. i have converted my personal frustrations into energy that propels me to find ways to fight for respect and dignity and against harassment and abuse. i also get to meet and talk to a lot of brilliant scientists and future scientists, and to those i dedicate my efforts to change the academic system for the better. my fight songs secret weapon everyone tells me that i look austere and serious. to be honest, that is an outside armor i use to protect myself.',\n",

can’t you take a joke?”. i told my manager the next day. he said, “that sounds like an hr problem.” hr told me, “why don’t just try to get along with people, ok?”. they never even spoke to the engineer. my contract was almost up and i left without asking for renewal. i’m afraid in a staff meeting, my co-worker said he’d told me about a scheduling change, but i hadn’t been notified. i asked him to repeat the information, he said he shouldn’t have to since i was already told. i insisted i don’t know, let’s discuss it now, and he told me we need to speak in private immediately so we left the meeting to go to a private room. as soon as the door was closed, he exploded in anger screaming about how could i embarrass him in the meeting like that! he punched me in the face. a month later, a different co-worker karate kicked me in the neck when i tried to give him a mop and told him to clean the floor after he deliberately poured a cup of tea out on the floor of my office. the employer told me in both instances, “it’s your fault that he was angry. you should just apologize.” i said no. i got fired. this has cost me the new manager in our first one on one meeting, my new manager told me he, “can’t stand the look of my stupid face.” he also accused me of lying about my qualifications. when i told him i was ending our meeting because of his unprofessionalism and his comments were uncalled for, he responded that he’d never said those things, i’m a liar and i’m attacking him. when i told my director, he replied, “he never talks to me like that, are you sure that really happened? you probably just misunderstood.” in that one moment i lost all my credibility for the next four years until that manager left. he purposefully made my life hell for four years. the answer to every difficult question i asked him was either, “why are you so emotional today?” or, “you’ll never understand the answer anyway so i’m not going to bother wasting my time telling you.” or “what you don’t understand is…”. i ended up with less important assignments and was disenfranchised from participating in meetings and major projects, which ultimately stagnated my career. something you should know about me the manager described above made a misogynistic joke about me specifically and i called him out on it on the spot. he filed an official complaint about me in retaliation for not laughing at his joke. our director was brought in to mediate. the manager explained that he was just yelling stuff at random, he doesn’t know what the words he said even mean, and he doesn’t have control over what comes out of his mouth anyway, so it’s not fair to hold him accountable for what he says and does. everyone else should learn to work around it because it’s not possible for him to change. i insisted he can and should do better, but the director bought his story. the director told me, “men are up here, women are down here, that’s the way it is. that’s the way it is at (this company) and that’s the way it is at (our department). that will never change. you must accept this.” he told me that i need to accept my subordinate role, put up and shut up, or leave. if i have the audacity to complain to hr, don’t bother, just leave. i decided i don’t accept, but was picky about what job i should take next. both the manager and director left shortly afterwards so i’m glad i stuck this one out. is there a bright side competing for leadership and management roles in my career. i don’t get taken seriously no matter what i do. i realize i either work for myself, or market myself as a high level independent contributor. i’ve given up on the idea that human resources is for the benefit of employees and can help resolve employee disagreements. hr is there to serve to best interest of the company, and usually that means getting rid of complainers. i gave up on pursuing more education. i’ve been told by several people over the years, “if you get too much education, you’ll never find a good husband.” fight song i get a lot less support from other women than i think there should be, like competition for the attention of a male manager. whatever nonsense i reject to preserve my dignity, there’s always someone who’s happy to accept it in order to get ahead. i don’t want to sink to that level, but my resistance to take part makes me look like the uncooperative one who’s causing a problem, where my intention is actually to raise the level of professionalism. secret weapon i’ve ended up unemployed and even homeless to avoid harassment and assaults from particular coworkers. bouncing from one job to another to escape bad situations rather than moving towards something i want looks bad on a resume. it became difficult to find new employment and to get meaningful references. constantly changing employers means starting on the bottom rung of the ladder over and over with little chance to build a professional reputation.',\n",

there is no construct of endearment, affection, or empathy, as has been suggested, that describes what you did. it was sexual harassment.and ultimately, there is how it left me feeling. maybe why i pushed so hard for something to be done before you went back on service, is the enormous effect your actions had on me and my fear they may do the same to someone else. sure, the frequent thigh grab was certainly uncomfortable. however, when you kissed me-it was a visceral feeling of sheer fear. and when you kept holding onto me after you kissed me and kept talking in my face, my mind was racing through what you were going to do next or what exactly was happening as i gritted my teeth and smiled back at you. this was followed by constant anxiety, frequent panic attacks, flashbacks and sleepless nights in tears over the next few hours, days, and weeks. your actions also opened old wounds i realized i never let heal. it wasn’t until this happened that i ever told anyone the full extent of the past. at first it was traumatizing but i’m learning to derive strength from having survived it. the last person who kissed me without consent then violently assaulted and tried to rape me. that is the fear your actions evoked; emotions of having your dignity and safety stripped away all at once. there is a key distinction between those events and these – he was a grad student without any power over me and i could eventually fight him back. you are in a position of power relative to residents and i never felt that i could ask you to stop grabbing my thigh or not kiss me. knowing someone’s past shouldn’t matter in deciding these actions were wrong. but i want you to realize that you never know what someone has been through nor do you need to. these two experiences have also shown me these behaviors are not reserved for just bars or drunk frat parties; academic institutions are not immune to this behavior.i am sure going to hr was not comfortable for you. what you may not realize is how hard i had to work to even get this to hr. sexual harassment and assault in many ways are a dual trauma-the pain of experiencing it and the re-traumatization of re-telling the story only to feel degraded, and alone over and over again. it took 6 meetings and phone calls on my end for a plan to be put in place. part of me regrets having reported it at all. i used to love our residency and my job but now i’ve lost so much trust of the established faculty because of what you did, because initially reporting this left me feeling even more isolated, and because here is where i was reminded of the worst night of my life. i’m sure being reminded of the past was something that was bound to happen. however, i hate that it happened here. for a while it took all my energy to show up here and keep from emotionally falling apart at work and i’m sure it will be a long journey pulling it back together.this may all seem hyperbolic in response to what really amounts to a few minutes of your actions. but it only takes a few seconds to minutes to harass or assault someone. that is how much power one has in this sphere-a few seconds to minutes of your action can cause significantly more pain. i don’t share all of this to chastise you and i am really sorry we are in this position. i share it because it’s a perspective that needs to be shared and i hope brings you greater understanding of this problem. i have given up on not yet. i’m afraid of damage to my reputation, repercussions from leadership and the attending i reported, of being further violated by people in positions of power or from people i thought i could trust, of the flashbacks and anxiety i face at work constantly. this has cost me an enormous amount of time in meetings, time spent dealing with my own emotions, money for therapy. is there a bright side i think reporting this has awoken people at my institution that is an issue that needs to be dealt with and understood better.',\n",

       " 'my worst moment hard to pick one worst moment, but how i found out would be right up there. i’d noticed some discomfort when i peed. a few days later, i noted a discharge on the inside of my underwear. i went to my doctor, who said the symptoms were consistent with either chlamydia or gonorrhea. since one antibiotic could be used to treat both, i decided to forego having a swab shoved into my already-tender urethra, so i don’t actually know which it was. the bigger question was how i’d gotten it, because i’d only had sex with one person recently (or ever), and that was my partner, who’d been studying physics abroad for the last several months and had just come home for break. sitting on our bed, i told her about all of this, and she shattered right in front of me. through sobs, she told me about leaving a party drunk, walking home by herself…. what she couldn’t bring herself to tell me, she alluded to so that i understood. i’ve given up on i’ve given up on recapturing all aspects of the person i was before this. most of the time, i believe that most people are basically good. but, i also often feel that many men aren’t all that far away from dumb beasts. not all, or even most, but many. this has cost me it cost me that relationship, for sure, and maybe others. in the past, this has cost me sleepless nights from nightmares, uncountable liver and brain cells, and probably some other health effects yet to be seen. i’ve struggled to restore a semi-normal sex life. something you should know about me i’m a man in stem. my partner was a woman in stem. the costs to her and damage done are obvious, but know that the blast radius from events like this is huge, with lots of casualties. is there a bright side there is. i’ve made it through all of this. i love the person i am, and every experience i’ve had has contributed to who i am now. in some ways, i have been forged in fire. and i’m so much fucking tougher than anyone would guess. my fight song i have a few. i have an amazing partner now who has been and continues to be a vital source of healing. i have incredible friends and colleagues, some of whom know about this, most of whom don’t. these are the positives. my other secret weapon is that i’m a cis hetero man, so shitheads will say things in front of me thinking i’ll go along with “locker room talk.” i’m also very observant, so i notice everything. these days, i remember just about everything, too. i am very committed to justice, and i can be very, very patient.',\n",
       " 'my worst moment i was struggling with my work in a graduate program due to severe health issues. my advisor suggested i speak with a much older grad student for support. he was nice and helpful at first, but this soon turned into violation of boundaries and persistent sexual harassment. when i spoke to my advisor about it, she said she could not believe he would act that way, and that i must have misunderstood or invited that kind of treatment. i worked hard to avoid this person for as long as i could, but eventually, the stress it caused exacerbated my health problems so much that i ended up taking a medical leave of absence that lasted two years. along with my other health issues, i became deeply depressed, and frankly, i was scared to go back. he was gone by the time i returned, and i finished my requirements as quickly as possible. i will never forget that my advisor, who was another woman, didn’t believe me. that still hurts. i have given up on expecting anyone else to protect me, even if it’s their job to do so. no matter what anyone says, it’s clear that faculty members and other university representatives are primarily interested in preserving their reputations, pretending everything is fine, and protecting whichever party is more powerful, which is almost never the victim. i’m afraid that my career will be ruined if i ever have anything truly awful to report. i lost two years of my life that should have been very productive. this has cost me this is just one example out of many when i’ve been sexually harassed and/or received unwanted romantic overtures in an academic or laboratory setting.',\n",

       " 'my worst moment when he persisted in stalking me even after he was warned that the police were aware of his behavior and that stalking was a felony crime in that jurisdiction. i have given up on nothing. i’m afraid that he is still harassing women. he’s an associate professor at the university of georgia. this has cost me probably not much. i ended up in a career that was much more satisfying and lucrative than staying in academia. something you should know about me i’m a fighter. and i’m a witch. really. i’ve been practicing feminist witchcraft since about 1984. is there a bright side i’m now working with scientific societies to end harassment at their meetings and conferences. my fight song “so ferocious” by carsie blanton [youtube link] secret weapon years of meditation practice.',\n",
       " 'my worst moment the first conference i attended as a grad student was held on a university campus. i arrived a little early, checked in for registration and headed over to the student union bar to see if anyone else for the meeting was congregating there. it wasn’t very busy at all and i was standing in a quiet corner wondering if to get a drink or leave when an older guy drinking a beer came over to me introducing himself as a professor from that university and asked if i was there for the meeting. i told him that i was and started to introduce myself. i have given up on “perhaps you’re not as horny as i am yet” and immediately pushed his hand against my stomach and down inside the front of my jeans and inside my underwear. i don’t know why i didn’t cry out, but i didn’t. instead, i wrenched away in horror and ran to the ladies bathrooms, acting purely on instinct. i’m afraid t being ok to be in a room alone with men that i don’t know really well. even though i now lead my own lab and have to attend many meetings with students, other professors, new colleagues etc. and have therefore been in the situation hundreds and hundreds of time, i still feel my heart rate go up and have difficulty concentrating if i can’t see a clear exit route. this has cost me that i will always feel so incredibly stupid for having such a long and ongoing negative reaction to an encounter that probably that lasted for less than two minutes in total and was in a fairly public place. it took me a really, really long time to accept that i didn’t do this (this life of fear and anxiety) to myself and, in dark moments, i still don’t really believe that. something you should know about me thousands in fees for private counseling. but i don’t resent those costs as much as i do the difficult-to-monetize opportunities i missed by avoiding events and situations when i knew i might feel threatened or may see this person again. i switched fields and this, together with my insecurities and anxieties, meant that i missed several opportunities that led to my career advancement lagging significantly, maybe 8 or 9 years, behind my peers. i eventually got myself together but, on starting my lab, i found that i was ineligible for several fellowships and grants that many people establish themselves with because i was too many years post-phd. unlike having had time-out to raise kids, i cannot explain in 250 words or less why this is or why i might deserve an exception. is there a bright side? i’m also not white. despite this single event being awful, it never made me think i should quit science. i know that most people in the community would never condone the awful actions of that individual. the moments that i think about quitting are always inspired by incessant low-level racist comments and statements of privilege and superiority by a surprising proportion of people. these make me wonder if our community is really as educated, evidence-driven and enlightened as it claims to be and if i really want to be a part of it. my fight song i’m ok with myself and who i am as a person! sure, i suffer from situation-triggered anxiety, but i’m kind and considerate to everyone at every level. i don’t claim credit when it belongs to someone else, i don’t steal other people’s ideas and i don’t bully or belittle students or anyone else. no matter how i’ve been treated, or how often i see others behaving in this way, i have not compromised on that. having made the decision to maintain my personal integrity, even if it means forfeiting a few scientific ‘wins’, makes me feel calmer and stronger. even if i don’t make tenure, or don’t keep achieve a lifetime career in science, at least i didn’t make moral compromises that i would live to regret. abusers, racists and bullies might gain some progress and a little power from their actions but, no matter what else they do, they will never be anything more than those labels. one day their behaviour will be known and rejected. as mlk said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice … and i have nothing to fear from it.']"

recommended, employment attorney (not the eeoc) when i was laid off. it didn’t get me my job back, but i was able to get a little more money out of the severance process (which i needed in the coming months while i was unemployed), as the attorney saw i had very valid claims. doing this, i was able to retain my dignity, despite the continuing gag order.. my worst moment the relevant metoo story that i will share concerns an ex-supervisor, who was not somebody i reported to initially. i worked in the laboratory that he managed, but reported to somebody else. in the beginning, we were friendly, as you are between colleagues. however, after some time, he would mention getting connected via facebook (which was relatively new at the time). this was not abnormal as he had friended the technicians he supervised, but i wanted to be selective about the friends i was with, by not adding colleagues who were merely acquaintances. he kept mentioning his yearly hunting expeditions, and at one point, invited me to go on a weekend hunt with him (alone. none of my other (female) colleagues present were invited. additionally, he was with partner and children!). i declined as gracefully as i could – something about having other plans, etc. the harassment started at the moment my line manager moved on to a new job, and it was relentless (it appears that my previous line manager had kept this guy at bay). harrasser had the others in the lab isolated me, he started to question the quality of my work, he tried to convince the new director to review 2 years of work i had performed! keep in mind, he had verified months of my work without problems, so how it all of a sudden became a problem now that we had a new director, i cannot explain it. i have given up on i took weeks of sick leave due to stress. with the eventual department closure, i required an additional 18 months to gain back the confidence to begin a new job search. this has cost me i lost at least 18 months of salary. i have lost 2.5 years due to depression as a consequence of the bullying. the loss in confidence is incalculable. is there a bright side living through negative experiences means you learn about life, and hopefully can enjoy the full spectrum of what it can offer you, whether good or bad. hopefully i can learn what type of behaviors to accept and be more assertive when they swerve into behaviors i do not like. secret weapon good supportive brother and friends. my worst moment ever really loving science again. i wanted to quit then, but everyone told me that if i did that, i would be letting him win. they said that when i moved institutions it would be better. but it wasn’t, and it isn’t. it’s been 13 years and four institutions. i haven’t gotten over it, i’m still looking for that love of science, and i’m still afraid to quit. i have given up on that i didn’t do enough. that i will always feel weak. that i will always distrust not only men in power, but the women they surround themselves with. i’m afraid 13 years of crippling migraines, which appeared for the first time during that period, and brought so many doctors appointments, therapies and drugs trying to lose them again. i’ve lost friends who didn’t believe me, or who thought i should just let it go. i had to change my research focus to escape his circle of influence. i left papers unpublished and grants half-written. this has cost me i used to believe in taking the high road and trying to hold on to grace. i now believe in fighting fire with fire. it’s time for change. something you should know about me some people did believe me. some people gave me opportunities despite the black cloud that hung over me. some people trusted me, and they weren’t always the people that i would have expected. i’ve felt grateful to those people in ways i will never forget. is there a bright side three little birds secret weapon speaking truth to power.. my worst moment was when either when fellow grad student tried to rape me at night in the lab and my graduate institution tried to expel me for fighting him off. but i’d called the city police who took a report, and used it to threaten name the dean as a material accessory after the fact to attempted rape. or perhaps it was the time a senior faculty member had me fired from a staff it support position i held between finishing my masters and starting my phd thesis — when i refused to date him. but i really think the worst moment was the day after i asked for maternity leave from the tenure-track faculty position i’d landed a major research institution and the dept chair (who’d tried to get me to stay at his apartment when i was applying for the job!) fired me on the spot, causing me to miscarry three weeks later, bleeding badly due to the stress. i almost died. my prospects of ever having a family certainly did. i have given up on an academic career as a scientist and ever having a family of my own. i’m afraid of i am afraid of having no health insurance, nothing to retire on, and no children to support me in my old age. i guess i should have gotten a more serious education — more serious than a phd in computational physics, anyway. or perhaps i should have taken up something more practical and technical — more practical and technical than software engineering. do you think? what has this cost you? i worked as a software engineer continuously for 20 years after the worst moment. i’m not even close to retirement age, but age discrimination is starting to hit, which compounds the gender discrimination which is rife in high tech. i haven’t been able to find work since 2014. something you should know about me having time to write. is there a bright side mr big stuff my fight song writing.. my worst moment at my new job, over a year and a half after leaving his lab, i get an inappropriate email from my ex-supervisor. and then another. and another. all together, more than 30 emails over a few hours. revealing that he had feelings for me, personal information from his past, and “reminiscing” about things that had never happened between us. it was shocking and out of nowhere, and i was so upset i had to leave work early and go cry on my spouse. i have given up on feeling comfortable communicating with him, so i do not use him as a reference, and avoid conferences i think he might be at. we are still in similar fields and know some of the same people, but nobody outside of my closest colleagues knows what happened. i’m afraid someone in a position of power or influence will find out, and they will just focus on my behaviour and use it to doubt my accomplishments. that they will take the fact that we napped in the same hotel room once while traveling for a conference as evidence that i encouraged this somehow. looking back on that now, i am so ashamed that i didn’t realize how incredibly inappropriate it was. this has cost me at least a year of training, and a lot of mental anxiety. hard to put a figure on, but i would estimate ~ 30-40k. something you should know about me i persevered. despite all this, i kept going in my training and am now a new prof. and i will watch for and defend every other woman who follows me, because nobody should have to deal with crap like this to do what they love. is there a bright side i cannot imagine what would have happened if i knew what he was thinking about me when i was in the lab. the fact that it came out after i left almost certainly saved my career, i would never have been able to finish my degree if i had known. secret weapon a very solid sense of self, and an incredibly supportive spouse.. my name is dr. rachelle jones there are multiple women in stem with this name, no other identifying information was given by the author. if you wish to say this is not your story, please write us @metoostem on twitter or [emailprotected] dot com) i have given up on speaking out in defense of myself. this has cost me mental health i’m in therapy, of course, working with a grief counselor to learn coping strategies for the loss of a career and the anger that i feel towards the administration. i’ve spent a couple thousand dollars on this so far, $2000. something you should know about me i’m ashamed of myself for keeping quiet. is there a bright side? setting long term goals and working only towards them.. my worst moment “wow, i am impressed with you! i don’t think of women as engineers”. i was shocked that he said this out loud. he was telling me that i was impressive “for a woman”. in the same conversation he asked me if i wanted to have kids, and then told me that i should do it sooner rather than later since women’s reproductive organs start to deteriorate after 30. i have given up on when the situations happened to me in graduate school absolutely no one stood up for me. i was alone, isolated, and was made to feel like i was being unreasonable for trying to ruin men’s careers. i thought there was something i was doing to cause this behavior from men. and my career has been plagued by feelings of self doubt and a fear of how my behavior makes men in my field feel. this has changed the way i approach presentations, collaborations, and interacting publiclyin my field. i’m afraid trying to get justice for what happened to me or believing that these issues won’t continue to happen over my career. i have not given up on trying to get justice from others and trying to protect young women from similar situations. this has cost me if you asked me 3 years ago, i would say that i was afraid that this would continue to happen to me – it has continued with multiple other incidents. i have given up on worry about that at this point. what i am really afraid of nowis this pattern is continuing with younger generations. there are situations coming to light where men in my generation are perpetuating these issues and creating hostile work environmentsfor junior female trainees and that scares me. something you should know about me this cost me a lot of lab time. there was an entire year that i stayed out of the lab because my harasser was there. this means that my work was limited and had to be done on weekends. on the job market this lost me job opportunities. is there a bright side i am a victim, but i don’t see myself that way. i am strong and confident, which has meant that people tell me to “be tough” or “you can deal with it” when these issues happen. my fight song my first thought is no. absolutely not. however, when i think about it more, yes. i got through these experiences and as a mentor of junior women now, i have the opportunity to protect them from these situations. secret weapon declined to answer. my worst moment running down four flights of stairs in the nearly empty math building, tripping and falling as i stumbled outside, feeling sick to my stomach as i questioned if i’d “overreacted” to my 60+ year-old professor’s advancements. i have given up on math. i loved it, i was passionate about it, i wanted to study nothing else. but i couldn’t be in the classroom with him, and it destroyed my math career. i’m afraid i overreacted. i under reacted. i misunderstood. i took it out of context. i should have reported it – did others suffer because i didn’t? what was the real harm anyway? he never touched me – so why, 29 years later, do i still feel dirty and nauseous when i think about that night? this has cost me $200,000 in lost wages/opportunity. $50,000 in therapy (largely covered by my insurance). $85,000 in related psychological treatment worsened by my trauma. something you should know about me i survived, and now am a talented, caring accounting professor who defends my students and my children from any sort of unwelcome advances or harassment. is there a bright side? pink – you and ur hand [youtube link] my fight song i listened to my gut and got out before he touched me. i’m incredibly proud of myself for that. my gut and my head kept me safe; my faith and my family keep me going.. my worst moment i was at my first conference as a new assistant professor and began having a conversation with a very prominent person in my field. he was one of my science heroes- kind of cool and edgy and youngish but still super smart. so, i was in awe he wanted to spend the evening talking with me. unfortunately those weren’t his only plans because after an hour or so of what i thought was great conversation he asked me back to his room. i declined. i never told anyone and thought that probably i had just given him mixed signals? i have given up on the notion that people are able to change. i now just hope that we can make it to the next generation of men and that they will be better. i’m afraid he’s doing it to other people and i am partially responsible because i’m too scared to speak up and lose my career. this has cost me at least one talk at an important conference. many hours worrying about having to see him again and whether he’s trying to ruin my career. the ability to have normal conversations with male colleagues without being anxious about ulterior motives. ultimately, it makes me question every day if i’m where i am because i deserve it or because i was put there at the whim of some men who like me being in the field. something you should know about me this has only strengthened my resolve to stay in academic science and succeed. the best way to fight these abusers is from the top. fight song it got me truly invested in empowering women to stay in science my secret weapon my inner circle of friends and colleagues. they know what happened and have my back always. it makes facing him at conferences less scary.. my worst moment discovering that my best friend in graduate school and classmate in my program, essentially my partner in crime battling the forces of physics homework and tackling research ideas and oral qualifying exams together (who, by the way, also consistently wore the “not a bystander” t-shirts advocating for sexual harassment awareness distributed by my school and touted himself as an ally to women), had set up a video camera in our bathroom (he was one of my three roommates) in order to record me showering, putting on lotion, etc., so that he could pull up these videos at any time on his phone or home computer and masturbate to the images of my naked body. i still do not know whether he still has these videos or if they have been circulated online. i found out about the video camera in my bathroom after several months of it going on (actually, i’m still not really sure – it could have been happening for over a year). when i discovered the camera and confronted the perpetrator about it, he realized i had seen the camera and had pulled out his gun (which he had a concealed carry license for) to clean it. when i asked ‘what the hell’ he was doing (meaning, what was the camera), he claimed he was merely looking up guns online. in hindsight, i recognize this moment as a frightening assertion of power and aggression. i immediately locked myself in my room with my dog. it took me several months, living with this person and seeing them at school every day, before finally reporting the incident to my school. there were many moments after i confronted him that he consistently re-asserted his dominance. he would say things like “the only real power in the world is achieved through violence”; or he came to my desk once, wearing his “not a bystander” t-shirt (mind you, *after* i had confronted him) and talked about how he wanted to put up pictures of my dead mother around my desk. in his testimony for the eventual investigation by the school he compared me to a donut shop “anyone walking by a donut shop cannot resist the temptation to go inside.” i have given up on trusting most men, particularly the ones that are the most obvious, apparent allies. it’s time women stand for women, and women run for congress, and women becomes ceos, and women change the system by working from the top. i’m afraid that videos of me are on the internet, on some voyeurism website. that i’m not the only one the perpetrator did this to; that he’ll do the same thing again, somewhere else. that he still views the videos he recorded of me even after being exposed for what he did. that he’ll find a career being a supervisor to people including women and find a way to exploit their bodies. this has cost me the biggest impact has been on my mental health. i dealt with ptsd for several months after reporting to my school and will likely carry some version of my paranoias — such as locking my bedroom door at night and always checking the bathroom before undressing to shower — for a long time.during the investigation by the school, i often had to stay home from school due to distress or fear of running into him on the way to campus. i fell very behind in my research and ended up presenting a poster at the major conference in my field on minimal results. i had to find a new roommate to replace the perpetrator in my apartment — this took much time and resources. something you should know i will fight for my sisters on this earth and i will never give up. is there a bright side i found some truly amazing friends in the process, who helped me find the courage to report the perpetrator to my department and school. i feel lucky he was eventually expelled from the program and the school. i think the #metoo movement, which was launched the same month that the investigation by the school started, really helped me find my courage and also applied pressure to my school to do the right thing. granted, i was still discouraged by the school to talk to the police, and they were hesitant about launching a full-blown investigation, but we eventually got there. it is because of the boldness of the women before me, and the women at my side, that my story didn’t fester in my mind and destroy my career, and that my story has a happier ending than most. my fight song “confident” by demi lovato and “shake it off” by taylor swift secret weapon my friends and my boyfriend.. worst moment in a meeting with a c-suite member, a manager, and a coworker, the c-suite member told all of us some pretty awful things about a person outside the company (i’ll call him andrew). the c-suite member was being absolutely callous about very sensitive topics (which andrew was dealing with), and my coworker made horrified sounds. i expressed my discomfort to the manager using our internal messaging system, and he told me that he just reminded my coworker that she signed an nda because of how the conversation was going. when my coworker left the meeting, the c-suite member told us that he wanted my coworker to “use her feminine charms” to talk to andrew, as he was a lifelong womanizer, she’s young and bright, and he’d definitely open up to her. i was very uncomfortable that he was using my coworker for that purpose, and said as much to hr and my manager. they didn’t do anything other than tell me how i can tell the c-suite member why that’s not appropriate. (for reference, i don’t work in hr. if i did, this would be more appropriate.) i have given up on i’ve given up on telling the story of how i’ve been treated at my company for fear of being fired, sued, or never working in stem again. i’ve given up on being paid an industry-standard salary. i’m afraid every time i go to a work event, my friends and i check in with each other to make sure none of the sleazy men at our company have talked to us. i’m constantly looking over my shoulder. every time a male coworker says something inappropriate to me, i feel like tearing my skin off is the only way to be clean again. i’m afraid that feeling will never go away.my coworkers say that they love working at our company because there are a lot of strong personalities here and they’re allowed to be themselves at work due to the work culture. i have a strong personality hidden under fear, and that’s not fair. this has cost me approximately $1,200/year for therapy costs, $300/year for psychiatrist costs, and $100/year for daily anxiety medication. this doesn’t include psychiatric hospitalization costs when it gets to a breaking point. something you should know i want to go back to school to become a biochemist so i can do research on the chemical nature of anxiety and how to work with that from a medical perspective. it’s funny that working in stem has given me so much anxiety, and therefore i want to further entrench myself in the field in order to alleviate anxiety for others in the future. is there a bright side i feel like my work is worth something. i’m not sure it’s worth the harassment i endure. but i do know it’s important. my fight song buried alive, by avenged sevenfold. it seems depressing (the closing lyrics are “this is now your life, die buried alive”) but screaming “get your fucking hands off me!” in the middle of the song is somehow empowering. secret weapon i take incredibly detailed notes about everything that happens at work. names, dates, exact quotes, screenshots of conversations– everything. this is partially because i work in an at-will state and if i’m fired, i need to have fodder for a wrongful termination lawsuit. but it’s mostly because i like knowing that this is going to come out, and when it does, i’m going to take every last one of these absolute pieces of shit down. i remember reading about a japanese-american man who started keeping a diary on december 7th, 1941. when i read that, i thought what it must be like to know that history was going to get weird and only you can tell the story that’s happening. that’s how i feel right now.. my worst moment i was stalked, sexually-harassed and even date raped at my university, which i later found out did not only cover up my complaints against the harassing tutors and lecturers but everyone else’s as well. 20 years after my experience i read in horror that almost 60% of students there claim to have had similar experiences! my worst #metoo moment though was when i went on the largest female expedition to antarctica to “combat sexism in science” and instead we were bullied by the female leadership and – some of us – sexually harassed by the male crew. when we tried to make it safer for the next cohort, we were ostracised, defamed and slut-shamed by some of our “science sisters”. the hypocrisy and lack of empathy by some of our own felt actually worse than what i experienced at the hands of men. i have given up on the so-called sisterhood. women can be as bad, if not worse than some men – and just because they are women does not mean they automatically feel empathy for victims of abuse. in the end everyone seems to look out for number one, and if #metoo complaints are seen as too difficult or bad publicity that could impact on their bottom line or career advancements, women are just as likely to brush them under the carpet as the “old white boys club”. i’m afraid that there will never be equality or fair treatment of women especially if we play into the gender and societal stereotypes that cause inequality in the first place. this has cost me $30k for the trip plus 1.5 years of stress from the harassment. at least 500 hours were spent by me and a handful of others combating the leadership that caused these issues. as student, when i got assaulted by tutors, lecturers and other students, i lost my will to study, gained 35kg and was suicidal for a year and a half. something you should know about me i’m a fighter against injustice, tenacious as hell and completely allergic to narcissists. i also very much realise how utterly privileged i am compared to most women on the planet – having been born white, in a rich country and being able to follow my dreams to study what i wanted and become a scientist. is there a bright side the women who fought with, and alongside me will be lifelong friends. my fight song i will refuse by pailhead secret weapon releasing the kraken!. my worst moment when my advisors called me lazy. i have given up on academia i’m afraid the system will never be fixed. this has cost me a project, a paper, delayed graduation date, and switching lab groups. something you should know about me i stand up for myself. is there a bright side i am more motivated to help other women. my fight song don’t stop me now – queen [youtube link] my secret weapon my mom. my worst moment how to choose a singular ‘worst’ moment? hmm, i’ll focus on my experiences as a postdoc. i have a phd in biophysics and biochemistry, and my focus was on instrumentation (i.e. building new tools with which to examine biological systems), and i was hired to do a postdoc in single molecule spectroscopy. i was working on building a single molecule flow cytometer to facilitate early leukemia diagnoses. this required me to spend most of my time in the laser lab, at my laser table. a laser table is surrounded by thick rubber curtains to keep any stray beams from escaping. when you use the laser, you turn on a red light that tells others not to come in. at the time i worked there, the lab had just come back from a full shutdown due to safety reasons, and so safety was a big deal. whenever we changed our laser setup, we had to get approval from the laser safety officer to restart experiments. i went to get such approval one day, and the lso and i went into my enclosure and turned the red light on. however, instead of inspecting my laser setup, the lso decided to inspect my setup with his hands on my breasts. now, normally, i would have beaten a dude that tried it to a bloody pulp, but the lab had a strict ‘zero violence in the workplace’ rule, and i had small children at the time, so i didn’t rip his dick off and feed it to him. instead, i reported the incident to my manager. the lso claimed we were dating, so it was okay (we were not dating, we weren’t even friends), and my boss did nothing. unsurprisingly, three months later, a paper was published, in which my boss and the lso were co-authors, so my being groped in my workplace by a superior took a back seat to his publication.there was also the time my male colleagues on a project involving antibodies were complaining about their fluorescent label blinking during experiments. they decided that adding a fairly high concentration of an incredibly strong reducing agent would fix this. when i, the only one in the group with any experience working with biological molecules, pointed out that antibodies were held together by disulfide bonds, and thus, the reducing agent would destroy their sample, they acted like i was an idiot. six months of taxpayer-funded salary for two researchers later (approximately $48k of taxpayer money), they sat in lab meeting and announced that the reducing agent had destroyed their sample. i have given up on working in scientific research. i’m afraid if we leave these idiot men in charge, we’ll never advance scientifically. this has cost me $770k in lost wages as a researcher. is there a bright side no there is no bright side to going into student debt to the tune of $100k only to have your career ended because you picked biophysics instead of something more ‘girly’ like cancer research.. my worst moment justice. my boss has gone on to international fame and is still surrounded by young intelligent women who are dependent on him for their careers. i have given up on the old stale pale male rules stem. the rumors about male professors and their young female ras are everywhere. we are disposable. i’m afraid of i lost my job. i had to move to another area of health and start over. i was too shaken to begin a phd for years. i worked as a low paid ra until my wounds started to heal. i trusted no one. this has cost me i was a young, funny and enthusiastic women when i started in this position. my boss was also relatively young and lots of fun to be around. i was part of his research team which was completely made up of young women with large breasts. we called ourselves the dd club. we worked hard for our boss and he rewarded us by putting us on publications (which we deserved) and taking us to conferences. at my first overseas conference he took me out and we got drunk and had sex. i didn’t want to but i didn’t want to offend him. i felt horrified the next day. after that he hounded me for more sex even though i made it clear i wasn’t going to do that again. one, he was married with a family and two, i did not find him at all physically attractive. things broke down very quickly and he made my working life very difficult. he ended up taking me to hr. he must have been very confident i wouldn’t tell them what happed. i didn’t. i felt i had been complicit. i ended up leaving without another job and no references. i found out later he had affairs with other members of the team before, during and after my time. i came to realize that my achievements were my own. because i kept on achieving. you should know all star – smashmouth is there a bright side humor. my worst moment this is a long term story. a lot of the things i realize now were not easy to understand as they happened. i have known the guy for a long time (10+ years). at first i thought he seemed quirky. i was warned not to hang out with him but brushed it off as bullying. i was never close to him, however, during many years he chatted with me from time to time, always telling me weird stuff i have given up on my phd’s entire social life. a phd is already a lonely thing, and mine was very hard for that. it caused me to be like a ghost to my department. i am also normally a social person that likes to entertain. i would have loved it so much to have my research group over at my place for bbq’s, but i never could, because i would have either had to either include him, or exclude him and risk him getting angry. in my many years in grad school, we ended up having only one group dinner. i hid away so much that very few people came to my phd defense, but he wouldn’t miss it. i’m afraid he’s going to kill me or hurt my loved ones. even writing this, i’m afraid he will recognize the story and get mad… every night i lock my door thinking of him. at the same time i’m so scared to be the bully in this story! i’m taking the chance to share this because i want people to know that violence is not quirky, it has consequences, especially on women. this has cost me the lack of social implication during my phd has caused me to lose a postdoc grant of $80,000. i am still unsure of my future in academia, in part because of that. the guy also got a department “excellence grant” of $7000 for his phd, because he hung out with many professors (the criteria for excellence were very unclear). the thing is his own advisor was on a sabbatical and wasn’t even consulted for that. if he had, he would not have approved. using objective criteria like publications, comments received at my defense etc., i believe it’s possible that i lost that grant because of my lack of presence. not to mention that a grant like that looks well for future job applications of course. i also spent a lot of money in therapy for the anxiety this caused me. something you should know about me i’m fun when you get to know me. is there a bright side got to spend a lot of time with my dog during my phd! my fight song is there life on mars? -sorry not very “fighty”! [youtube link] secret weapon working super hard and hoping it gets recognized. possibly moving away.my worst moment when my boss threatened to fire me and keep me from jobs or when a senior male colleague told me we would not hire more women, ever. i don’t know what is worse. i have given up on a career in science where i am treated equally to my colleagues. i’m afraid i will lose my job, be excluded from funding, or not be able to find a new job if my boss knew i said anything. this has cost me at least 100k (because i had a fellowship, my boss didn’t pay me the nih stipend. by the time i purchased my own health insurance i made less than most trainees with less experience than i did. those trainees also happened to be male). something you should know about me all i ever wanted to do was science that might help people who are suffering. i cannot believe how political that simple thought can be. is there a bright side it is getting harder to find. secret weapon i have a twitter account that has all the non-professional sexist things people have said to me during my training. it’s depressing, but at least it is time-stamped.. my worst moment i had made it into my dream graduate school- ranked #1 for my field. it’s my first semester. i am raped by another graduate student in my lab. i report to title ix. the title ix officer stresses to me during my initial report that “if your side of the story is true, there’s nothing they can do to get out of this.” she’s trying to comfort me, i understand now…but this statement was so damaging. the next five months are humiliating half of my lab is interviewed as witnesses and now know, i am gossiped about in the department, glared at by friends of this student in seminars, and i still see this person daily. it takes five months to reach a finding. despite what i was told by the officer, it’s determined that there’s not enough evidence to do anything. after five months of a sloppy title ix investigation, i don’t even bother thinking about appealing. i just wanted this to end so i could move on with my life. i have given up on respecting leaders in my field. the person that raped me recently published multiple high impact papers and is being prepped for an academic career. how many other well-respected rapists are thriving in my field? i’m afraid for this person to become a supervisor. this has cost me a year of graduate school that i repeated, the loss of networking and a prestigious degree…a lot. something you should know about me i am a huge supporter of counseling. it took me several tries to find counseling that i found helpful, but when i did, it really improved the quality of my life. is there a bright side i was able to keep my fellowship and go back to graduate school at another program a few months later. it’s been incredibly difficult, but i’m now in my second year. my love for research slowly returned despite the months i spent unable to even think about science. i originally went back to grad school just to not let this be the end of my story – and i stayed because i realized i still love what i do. my fight song same old blues by phantogram. it’s not a happy song, but it helped me not feel alone when i struggled with my mental health. now i play it to celebrate how far i’ve come. [youtube link] secret weapon a best friend that helped me through and a significant other that believed me.. my worst moment realizing that after years of fighting harassment, i still ended up letting myself be harmed by a powerful senior narcissist who i should have known was not really interested in my work, in me, or in helping me. power differentials affect consent. i have given up on having my work taken seriously; not being seen as an object first (sexual or token; i’m a minority woman) and a scientist second; living without microaggressions; getting paid the same as my same-rank male colleagues despite having more grant money myself. i’m afraid that i can’t trust people anymore, and that nothing i do matters. that i’ll always wake up at night thinking about what happened to me. that i will never be able to move on. this has cost me i have a chronic migraine condition now. i don’t know how to begin to estimate the cost of that, but i also can’t say it’s wholly due to the stress of what happened. something you should know about me i take risks even though i’m anxious by nature. is there a bright side i still love my work and overthinking has been both my curse and my transformational freedom. my fight song robyn – don’t fucking tell me what to do secret weapon reframing, turning inward, compulsive exercise.. my worst moment i spent the first two years of graduate school in suffering. i had received an internship with a well-known scientific government organization, with an influential mentor. after a while, this internship turned into my master’s thesis, and so i continued to work with him. i have given up on sitting by idly while things like this happen to women and girls everywhere. it is shameful and appalling that in 2018, we are still devalued and showed bias against just for being or identifying as female. this type of treatment ruins lives, crushes dreams, and sets us up for failure. no more. i’m afraid that my future as a scientist in my field is ruined. with someone so powerful and influential spreading nothing but hate about me (and many others), how can i redeem myself to potential future employers and colleagues, who do not even know me? i am afraid that this fight may be lost before it even begins. this has cost me mentally, physically, emotionally, and financially in many ways. i have scars and permanent injuries due to my mentor’s lack of guidance in preparation for my first season of field work. i had to take an entire extra year of graduate school, costing me over $10,000. i had to start completely over and give up my life to complete a new thesis project in a single year. i had to go to counseling for half a year in order to be okay, to believe that it isn’t all my fault, and to pursue action. something you should know about me as early as two years ago, i would not have had the courage to share any of this. now, i see that i am not alone – and neither are you! together we are stronger. please, if you need support, or just someone to vent to, contact me on twitter (@glacialsara). is there a bright side throughout this whole process – from mental breakdowns, physical health plummeting, and constant stress and anxiety – i have found friendship and a support network stronger than i could imagine. so many women stepped up to help me and encouraged me to pursue action after what happened to me. it is only with their help that i can say i am not afraid. my fight song no apologies by jojo (youtube link) secret weapon cats. cats make everything better.my worst moment sara runs to relax after a six month period where her ex assaulted and stalked her, her lab became unsafe and a new faculty member turned a job meeting into a date. she declined to provide a photo i have given up “thanks for contacting me! you’ll enjoy the museum, i’ve been already and it’s great. would you like to meet up on campus and talk about your research?”). i showed up to our “meeting” with printed out copies of his paper annotated with my notes. he said “how flattering that you’ve read my papers.” when i told him i wanted to work with him, he told me doing a postdoc with him would be a bad idea for me. he also said he didn’t want to be my “boss” because it was “much more relaxing to collaborate as equals.” i’m afraid in the long run, leaving academia will lead to a higher salary for me, but it’s cost me a lot in terms of my dignity and mental health. in the short term, i have spent so much money on dental work from grinding my teeth from the stress (i had seven cavities). i also had swelling in my fingers from clenching my fists at night. this has cost me my university has played an amazing role in supporting me through the ordeal with my persistent ex. they have an mental health support team that is specifically trained to deal with sexual, gender, and intimate partner related violence. through that program, i completed therapy for the unspecified post trauma disorder and unspecified stress disorder which helped re-establish some feelings of normalcy. all of that helped me deal with the less traumatizing unwanted attention in the context of the more serious assault and harassment from my ex. the head of campus safety consulted with me about the costs and benefits of getting a restraining order or pressing charges against my ex for the assault (which ultimately i decided against). feeling like i was really supported by the university was a bright side in all of this absurdity. something you should know about me my secret weapon is long distance running which has been the only thing keeping me sane and calming my nerves enough to sleep at night. most importantly, my sister, my best friends, and my lab mates have always been there for me. no one else could help me find ways to laugh even in the darkest moments of this experience and keep me sane.. my worst moment i find in my university career that it isn’t just one moment. it’s a constant stream of moments that you one day look up from and say “well that’s not right.”. i have given up on anything in the system changing. we live in a culture of “brush it under the rug”. people will listen to your stories, they’ll believe you, but nothing will change. and often, i’ve found the very worst perpetrators are the ones who cry loudest about consent and assault. they genuinely understand consent, until it applies to them. and they can’t see anything wrong with their actions, though they’d be the first to denounce it if someone else did the same thing. and that is terrifying. i’m afraid to walk home alone at night, to walk past men on the street (even in daylight), to go to a party without a close friend. to not be able to find that friend at any point. to be more brutally assaulted, and the university, social groups i’m a part of, and police not care. to sleep with someone who i don’t know well. what happens if i tell them to stop and they don’t? because it has been an issue in the past. i’m afraid i’ll never find someone who will listen when i tell them “no.” this has cost me luckily, no economic costs as of yet. something you should know about me i am a confident person. i love my friends, my classes, my classmates, my social clubs. i love going to parties, and i’ve got lots of male friends as well as female. i love my life, and i’m happy. i love studying to be an engineer and excited to graduate and start working. but all this stuff, it constantly hangs in the back of your head. is there a bright side? smarts and hard work. even if you’re discriminated against, even if you have to be twice as good as the next guy to get the job, you can do it. and eventually, people will figure out you got where you are because you deserve it, not because you were a “diversity hire”. also, try not to let all those small moments get you down, because in between those moments is a really great time.. my worst moment within days of me moving to a lab on the opposite side of the globe from my home, a male colleague in the lab touched me very inappropriately. the postdocs and graduate students in the lab took his side, because get this – i was the one that came to this shiny first world country to score a white husband, and he was only trying to be friendly. when i complained to my pi (also white male), i was told to get along with the lab or else it would reflect in my letter of recommendation. i spent the first year of graduate school being ostracized by my lab mates, being yelled at by the perpetrator, and fearing for my life when i was alone in the lab with the perpetrator. i spent a couple years being depressed and it impacted my work negatively. this only made things worse with my pi, not only was i a ‘troublemaker’, but a ‘failure’ as far as science was concerned. after about 2 years i started documenting every interaction with the perpetrator and emailed the pi and him. the pi never responded to those emails, but the perpetrator stopped harassing me. things got better for me because i felt like i was finally in control. it’s been a few gruelling years but i will be graduating soon (as will the perpetrator). the sad part is that this is not the only perpetrator i have had to deal with in grad school, but he is by far my worst experience. i have given up on seeking help from anyone at the university. nobody cares, except my therapist and my close friends. i’m afraid of backlash. of being told again that i am a ‘troublemaker’. i didn’t ask for this, i just came here to do good science. this has cost me my mental health. something you should know about me i will pull through no matter what. is there a bright side i came out stronger, and found better friends. friends that will stand by me through thick and thin, and keep me company when known perpetrators are around. my fight song stronger – kelly clarkson secret weapon my friends. they always have my back.. worst moment i met him at the conference. throughout the week, he was excited and persistent to ski or go to the hot tub together. friends can do those activities together, so i happily obliged to go skiing together. we became good acquaintances and, i would say, friends. at the farewell banquet, we bumped into each other and i invited him to sit with me and my friends, a group of maybe six – eight other conference goers. he had a lot of drink tickets and distributed them to my friends in good humor. he would pull me aside to the bar and playfully push drinks on me. i resisted the drinks at first but gave in shortly. i have given up on “your boyfriend is a lucky guy. you’re adorable.” i started to feel uncomfortable at this point and looked down, gesturing discomfort with my body. i swept this moment aside because this comment was a first offense. i felt warm inside so i got up and told the table i was going to go outside. i did not invite him but he got up and told me to wait. he followed me outside. i was shivering and he took off his jacket to place it around my shoulders while facing me. in doing so, he got very close, nearly encasing me with his arms. i told him i felt uncomfortable and stepped back the first vocal indication and assertion. i took off his coat and gave it back to him but he refused to take it back. he said something along the lines “you’re so pretty; i can’t help it.” i’m afraid after a bit of recovery,nothing. he’s not going to define my future. this has cost m of networking/being friends with men but i will still strive to be successful in my field. something you should know about me peace of mind. is there a bright side i’m not just a victim. i’m a successful, happy person.. my worst moment when the academic i considered a role model and a mentor brought me up to his room at a conference and took my virginity. i was an undergraduate, he was my lecturer, and while he didn’t use violence, i was afraid of what would happen if i said no. i was able to keep it together until i saw the blood on the sheets, at which point i had a panic attack and started sobbing uncontrollably. i have given up on ever trusting male academics. i’m afraid that he has turned important contacts against me. i was an undergraduate when this happened, and i know that he has told a twisted version of events to at least one person my dissertation supervisor. while she has still provided me with a reference to go on for my masters, i have no idea what she thinks of me, and i am acutely aware that no matter how high i want to climb, he has the ability to sabotage my reputation and ruin my career. he is powerful and is a personal friend of all my academic contacts. i am a young woman in my twenties who hasn’t even started her second degree. this has cost me i turned down a phd with another supervisor for him (would have been worth 16,200/year had we won the funding bid), because he said he would be a better fit to supervise me, and that he would find me funding, but i had to wait until he had a supervision opportunity. i took a year out of academia and worked during this time to “wait” for him. i have now won a masters scholarship and will be going back to my studies in september, but no matter what, my path has changed irrevocably. i also lost out on a promotion worth almost 2,000/year as a result of the ptsd i developed. prior to the development of my symptoms, i had all but been promised this promotion, and it wasn’t until the trauma affected my performance that all discussion of it was dropped. as i am only just above living wage and live from paycheque to paycheque, this would have been a very significant amount of money for me. something you should know about me in hindsight, i can see that i was very naive, and made the wrong choices. but naivety isn’t a crime, and what you need to understand is that this man was nearing 50. i was 22. i had just come out of an abusive relationship, and was still being stalked by my ex. i had left my home country to go to uni, and was without family support. i was in love with my discipline and wanted to succeed. i desperate to have my ambitions validated. i deeply respected his academic work, and it meant the world to have him recognise potential in me. is there a bright side i am able to appreciate my own strength. to give a cheesy fall out boy quote “if i can live through this, i can do anything”. my fight song the march secret weapon my stubbornness, hard work and my ambition. i have achieved results far beyond what would be expected of someone as early on in their career as me. i have so much to offer and i refuse to let him break me.. my worst moment after over two years of constant harassment by a senior male who was my supervisor, and multiple complaints to my institution that went nowhere, i quit my job and filed a complaint with an external body. i paid for my own lawyer while the institution assembled and paid for his defense team (yes team, not just one lawyer). at the hearing, i learned that other senior faculty lied to protect him, and the fact that i continued working with him was seen as evidence that i ‘consented’ to his behavior. the harassment was never acknowledged. he still works there in the same position. worst moment developing severe depression as a result of ongoing stress and powerlessness, and attempting suicide. i have given up on my former career path. i’m afraid that he has not learned anything and will do this again to someone else. that after seeing him get away with harassment unscathed, other people will believe they can get away with it too. that institutions will continue to protect harassers, and continue blaming and discrediting those who make complaints. this has cost me $4000 legal fees, $25000 lost wages, $2000 health costs (ongoing as i’m still receiving treatment for depression). something you should know about me even though it was one of the most difficult things i’ve ever done, i never for one second regret coming forward and making a complaint. knowing that i stood up for myself and called out this harassment is an eternal source of strength and pride. is there a bright side i was still able to use my qualifications and experience to get my next role in a different field (i know, i’m luckier than most), so my phd wasn’t completely wasted. i now work in a job i love and have an excellent supportive team and a genuinely kind and decent human being as my supervisor. secret weapon the truth.. my worst moment not my rape and not the pervasive sexual harassment i experienced conducting fieldwork, but the time my advisor asked me to travel across the country to be “the estrogen in the room” at an important meeting between stakeholders. he didn’t ask me to go because of my strong communication and negotiation skills, or because of the work i’d done leading up to this moment, or because i was co-managing the project. he asked me to go because i was a girl. i have given up on being able to trust that the men i work with and rely on will not let me down. i am afraid that if i share details of my rape or harassment publicly, people will lose respect for me and my science. this has cost me pervasive harassment sent me home from my fieldwork several months earlier than intended and i had to conduct another field season – i’d guess that it directly delayed completion of my phd by at least 6 months, which translates into 6 months earning a graduate student stipend when i could have been earning money as a postdoctoral scholar or tenure track professor. when i look at my cv and compare it to male colleagues, i know there are deficiencies and i know some of those are because of my experience with sexual violence and harassment, and being discounted or taken advantage of as a young woman. something you should know about me i love what i do and i love fieldwork and i love research, and nobody’s taking that away from me! is there a bright side i get to look over my accomplishments and feel like a badass every time i think about what i fought through to get my stuff done!. my worst moment not my worst, but while rotating through labs in graduate school a senior member of the lab and i were discussing my plans for my dissertation and how it was going well so far. he commented, “you’re probably successful because you’re cute. a lot of girls in this field aren’t so pretty and don’t get as much attention. it helps when you’re attractive.” i’m successful because i work hard, not because i’m cute. i have given up on low expectations for women in stem. i’m afraid my success will be boiled down to my looks. something you should know about me i’m lucky to not have encountered as much sexual harassment as i’ve heard about at my institution, and it hurts to call this a “victory.” is there a bright side no one can take away what you make for yourself. my fight song you’re the best around, montage song from karate kid! secret weapon publishing.. my worst moment a certain professor is known for drinking with students at parties and targeting young women for potential sexual liasons. given the power inequality it is difficult for these women to turn him down without fear of retribution. the other faculty know of his behavior towards young female scientists but no one does anything to stop it. i am a woman postdoc. i casually intervene if i see him engaging with a young woman who looks uncomfortable with the situation. my worst moment was when i left a party early and found out the next day he had been dancing and grabbing at one of the phd students in our program. she was afraid of upsetting him and i wasn’t there to stop him. i have given up on the hope that other faculty with equal power will call him out on his inappropriate behavior. i’m afraid that it someday it will go beyond inappropriate touching and the student will be too afraid to say no. something you should know about me i am a survivor of sexual assault. is there a bright side the #metoo movement appears to have incited fear in the administration to emphasize the importance of title ix and sexual harassment training. it also seems to have suppressed some of his more overt actions. secret weapon the young women in our group warn others of his behavior.. my worst moment in the last year of my phd, my phd advisor made it very clear that he was interested in me (this came completely out of left field for me), and i found myself in a series of inappropriate and awkward situations despite my very clear communication that i was not interested.in addition to effectively losing the ability to seek mentorship from my phd advisor for the rest of my career, this caused me to completely lose all confidence in myselfmaybe i wasn’t actually good at science at all?maybe him telling me that i was great had been a ploy in the hopes that i’d sleep with him?going into my postdoc, my confidence was the absolute lowest it’d ever been.starting a postdoc exactly as i questioned whether i had anything to offer at all was a terrible feeling. i have given up on i have given up on covering for him.it’s obvious that he is not supportive of me now, and colleagues who witness his behavior at meetings have asked me, “what’s his deal?do you guys not get along?”.i used to make some joke about him being an absentminded professor, ha ha, but now i just affirm their observation. i’m afraid 13 years later, he still harbors a grudge, and i still sometimes worry it could affect my promotion decision if the committee asks him for a letter. this has cost me in the year after this happened, i thought seriously about leaving science – the idea of seeing my phd advisor every year at meetings was scary. i’m so glad i didn’t; i love the chance to try to be the kind of mentor that trainees deserve. but it very nearly cost me my entire career (postdoc + faculty). something you should know about me i was lucky.this happened in the last 6 months of my phd; i was able to graduate, get out of that situation, and start a postdoc in another state.my postdoc advisor, it turns out, was and is a total mensch.i was very lucky that the acute phase where i faced him daily was so very short. is there a bright side i’m grateful for the very small (n=5) but amazing circle of folks that i’ve confided in – both friends and mentors. they are truly amazing. my fight song i don’t know what this means.j secret weapon i don’t know what this means.j. my worst moment i was harassed on two separate occasions during my postdoc. the first time, another postdoc had been hitting on me for a while when one day outside of campus he took it to touching and kissing me. i walked out. after repeatedly declining his subsequent advances he started spreading rumors of a sexual nature about me around the institution. this included not only fellow postdocs and grad students but also faculty members, including at least two that i directly worked with – at least that i know of. because we were both postdocs at the time, i reported this to the postdoc office only to be told that despite having direct witnesses, since « nothing had happened » they couldn’t do anything. i later learned of at least two other persons who were harassed by the same person. as of today, this person is still employed at this institution. i have given up on hope to see things improve at this institution in the foreseeable future. i’m afraid i’m still afraid of the second harasser to this date. i fear an encounter and i would never willingly be alone in the same room. i am working on letting my fears go but it’s taking time. this has cost me perhaps some work opportunities at my previous institution because of the rumors although this is impossible to quantify. hopes of pursuing an academic career at this institution who protects harassers. a number of therapy sessions to overcome my ptsd linked to the second harasser. many unnecessary steps making long détours just to avoid meeting these people in the workplace. something you should know about me i joined my institution title ix committee after those events. i thought it’d be empowering. it turned out to be utterly demoralizing. i watched a friend go through a complaint procedure and being pushed out of grad school while her harasser who was her own pi was left in peace. i realized title ix is here to protect the institution and not the victims. the piece of advice i wish i had been given is to not bother with the internal procedures and just file an actual complaint. is there a bright side i left this institution and now have a new job i love in a safe, supportive environment. secret weapon when i unfortunately encountered my harassers on campus, i did my best unbothered face to not give them any satisfaction, even though my heart rate would shoot up.my worst moment when i had to go to hr and defend myself when i was the one being wronged. when i had to sit there and listen to the lab head tech lie and back up the postdoc and say that i, the whistleblower, was the one creating the bad environment. i have given up on the idea that anyone will listen to what is true and what is right. i now believe the institute is only interested in covering their ass and preventing a lawsuit, and that the lab pi was only interested in having the problem go away but the valuable postdoc remain unscathed. i now see that everyone will lie to side with who is strong and no one will defend the lower ranking woman who is being wronged. i’m afraid that i am an outcast at my institution. that i have been labeled a troublemaker even though all i did was quietly and privately ask the postdoc to knock off the crude behavior. that the pi, whose goodwill i need to succeed in my career, was lost. even though the postdoc was harassing all the women in the lab, i was the only one who complained.it never hurt him one bit. he’s now an hhmi investigator. this has cost me the lab environment was so toxic it was all i could do to survive, i went home and wept every night for the next two years of my phd as i tried to make it through. i have lost opportunities and promotions by having been labeled a troublemaker at my institution for being the only one willing to stand up to the harasser and quietly ask him to leave me alone. because i was then labelled a troublemaker, i lost access to equipment and had to raise funds and buy my own and support it myself. i would estimate lost wages, lost opportunities and lost equipment and gained expenses to total $2 million. something you should know about me i was raised in the south and taught to always be gracious and polite. i was taught to choose my battles, focus on just the single most important problem, and try to address it quietly without making a fuss. is there a bright side diamonds are made in crucibles, with temperature and pressure. otherwise, you’re just carbon. my fight song rocky secret weapon grace and class. my worst moment i have been propositioned on multiple occasions by men who “mistook” my eagerness to discuss professional matters for sexual interest. rejection of these invitations has been received with varied levels of insinuation or direct accusation that this is my fault for putting myself in front of the man in the first place. now that i’m more experienced i can identify and pre-empt these situations more effectively, but that also means that the ones who get through are the real sob’s who go lower than i could anticipate. one action i could take to avoid this type of stressful situation is to not approach men directly, obviously that is bad for my career, but i still am much more aloof than i used to be. i know these are common experiences for professional women, and it’s continually frustrating. um, *you* would have happily gone through with it if i hadn’t walked away; but i did not say this to him. within the next few months he invited me to a special long-range planning workshop, and i accepted, my major advisor supported this great networking opportunity. i arrived to find that i was one of only 2 graduate students there, the other was local, and neither he nor i could figure out what our role was. socializing with the group at the hotel after the workshop, it was even more clear that nobody knew why i was there except that this senior organizer valued my presence for some reason, and even though we never did anything sexual, people were clearly wondering about it, and he was happy to let them wonder. it was humiliating. after that i stopped talking to him at meetings unless it was a clearly formal interaction, though i did intercept him creeping on other girls a couple times during the informal networking periods, because i finally saw his targeted pattern of being “supportive” of the insecure female graduate students at the meetings. i am still so ashamed of myself for being that girl. i have given up on i have let certain promising papers and projects fall to the wayside because i don’t want to collaborate with that worst man, or let him have any credit for any success that i can earn. i am afraid i know it can be so much worse, it is painful to hear other women’s experiences of physical harassment and antagonistic retaliation. i am afraid that if i make a bigger deal out of my experiences i will lose more time and reputation, or feed the backlash by accusing a “nice” distinguished professor of actually being a predatory narcissist. i am afraid that if i am too complacent, that the culture of acceptance of this behavior will grow and worse things will happen. this has cost me beyond specific dropped projects related to avoiding specific individuals, the consequent self-doubt, anxiety and depression has cost me substantial amounts of time and productivity over the years, quantifying losses impossible. some days, anger saps my mental energy, and some days motivation is extremely difficult to rouse. something you should know about me i’m shy and introverted to begin with, i can’t help but wonder if this makes me seem more vulnerable when i work up the motivation to talk to somebody but i know it’s not my fault no matter who tries to tell me so! i believe in myself and i’m proud that i have not quit, despite these men. i pride myself in my work, and i enjoy my work, i can’t quit that. i do show my anger when people try to use me, calling people (usually men – maybe because they are most commonly in the position to take advantage of people) out on their bad behavior, and that meets frequent resistance, and i am very frustrated that i can’t see an immediate path to change. is there a bright side when i was younger, i never trusted guys my own age, but i did trust older men who were my teachers and mentors (and i did have wonderful male role models growing up). these issues began after entering academia professionally, and the worst ones noted are directly related to men manipulating power differentials and seeking the admiration of younger women to promote their status and ego. as i’ve gotten older i find more allies in men and women my age colleagues at the same level building our professional careers with (not on the backs of) our peers, and colleagues concerned for the independent success of their students, both male and female. i have hope for the future.. my worst moment the postdoc who was supervising my work sexually harassed me (verbal harassment as well as unwanted contacts) since the start of my phd. when i felt strong enough to finally speak up after two and a half years, i realised that my group leader, who is a woman, as well as the whole directorate of my institute just tried to sweep my complaint under the rug. my group leader blamed me for what had happened saying it can’t be that bad if it took me more than two years to complain and that i am a pretty woman, so it should be expected. i felt betrayed and insulted, but did not lose hope because i was getting support from other victims of this postdoc. i officially complained and got three other victims to testify. this postdoc was not fired and did not get any warnings but they gave him the option to resign. he has since left the institute. i have given up on the reasons why i started this phd, i have given up on loving science. i lost all motivation to pursue a career in academia, as i won’t ever trust academics again. i’m afraid that i won’t have the strength to fight to finish my phd. and that i will never get justice. i am also afraid that this happens to others and that it remains unpunished. this has cost me my self-confidence especially regarding my professional skills. something you should know about me i am strong and this will not stop me. i know where i am going and i a is there a bright side i am extremely grateful and feel very lucky that i have such an amazing family and such caring friends who stand with me in this fight. my boyfriend has played an essential role, he was the one who opened my eyes and fully supported me, i owe him a lot. i would have not been able to fight without them. i realize that none of what happened was my fault. i will always call out unacceptable behaviours and more than anything, i want to stand up for others. my fight song secret weapon laughing about pretty much anything and kickboxing class!. my worst moment i was raped in a hotel room at a conference – he was a well-respected leader in my field. i have given up on that the societal conditioning of us, the gaslighting of women, is so engrained and insoluble that it will remain a barrier for myself and others coming forward, that those perpetrators will remain clueless to their assaults and live without consequence. i’m afraid i am a successful ecr academic, i can confidently talk about my research. i love what i do, and i do it because i want to make the world a better place, and the biggest thrill i get is working with other people who want to change the world too. i have always tried to vehemently stand up for other women and call out sexism when i see it, and inappropriate behaviour towards others. more than anything, i want to help promote kindness in stem. something you should know about me setting long term goals and working only towards them.. my worst moment i started my first faculty job at the same institute as my then husband. things were fine for a while. one night, we threw a dinner party for several work colleagues. he waited until everyone had left, then attacked me. he kicked me in the back, mauled my arms with his fingernails, then finally wrapped his hands around my neck and slammed my head into a wall. i was frozen with fear and shock and disbelief. humiliated and terrified, i told no one and just kicked him out of the house. he continued harassing me at my office. he would walk by my house and stand outside my windows waving. he would call my office repeatedly and then begin screaming if i picked up. when i finally did come forward, i was stunned to be met with general apathy. the head of hr told me this was my personal problem, and that if i didn’t like it i should move. the head of my institute characterized the situation as me “disparaging” my ex for telling people the truth about what he’d done. i have given up on getting justice. getting anyone to care. getting my life back. trusting mutual friends/colleagues who know about this and still socialize and collaborate with him. i’m afraid my institute will retaliate against me for this post. my children will see this and be traumatized. he’ll see it and try to hurt me again. this has cost me 10,000 to lawyers. hundreds to my therapist. years of working more slowly because i was still processing the trauma. grants i didn’t write because i was attending court hearings and meeting with my lawyer. conferences i couldn’t attend because i’m a single mom now, or because he might be there. something you should know about me it took me a long time to be light hearted and have fun again, but i’m doing it. is there a bright side i now know i can survive anything. my fight song changed the locks — lucinda williams secret weapon i have pictures of what he did.. worst moment my department head told everyone that i was ‘not smart’ and that mutated into ‘she is stupid’ which was bought by everyone, including grad students, who would smugly laugh at me in the hallways, even walk by my office and say loudly ‘ya she is dumb’ or laugh at me when i walked into instrument rooms. people said i got tenure only because i was a woman and that i was dumb. the gaslighting was so bad and so hurtful that i had to resign my tenured position to find peace. that was almost 20 years ago and i never considered the financial impact until later, when i found myself downsized in the recession. now i am nearly broke when those assholes have great retirement plans.i am so angry. i have tried to write a book about this, disguising everyone, but its so hard.before i resigned, i gave a seminar on my work in a neighboring dept, but the slander had spread there, and people laughed at my work. it was so cruel that i passed out at the end of my seminar, and everyone left the room. i actually passed out and people were laughing. it was so so cruel.after i left, then neighboring departments lied about my complaint, said i was never sexually harassed even tho they were told by the vp of the med school and prof schools to shut up about me.gender played huge huge role which is why i accused them of gender discrimination. everyone it seems that stayed there hates me and thinks i am a liar and that i’m stupid. it has ruined my life to be honest.it was the worst most horrible experience of my life.but i loved my work, i loved having students, publishing my work, and doing the science.i could never afford a good lawyer so i couldn’t really launch a lawsuit, which would have been very ugly and made my life even worse.my former friends in science shun me. think i’m fucked up. that is one of the worst things about this.no one prepared me for the hostility and gaslighting and slander. i have given up on everything and everyone. the severe depression has ruined my life.i try to take it one day at a time. i’m afraid afraid of speaking out more, afraid of writing my book i signed an nda but so did they, and they did not follow the nda continuing to bad mouth me for years after i left. my reputation ruined. they bad mouthed me but i had no proof. if i write my book and i am revealed, i will get sued because i signed an nda. but faculty think an nda means ‘talk shit about her to everyone’.it’s sick. this has cost me over $2,000,000 in wage and benefits over 20 years and much more in retirement money that i lost out on.my mental health has been adversely affected and in the rural area that live in because of economic constraints imposed by me having to resign a lifetime position, i cannot getthe help i need.lost opportunity with collaborators, students, publications. my scientific career destroyed. something you should know i’m funny, smart, loved my science and was really fucked over. i wish i could move on. with the financial constraints it is indeed hard. is there a bright side one day at a time. secret weapon now i live in a forest and its cleansing and healing. but i’m still angry.i have 20 publications that i’m proud of.but people in the field do not cite me because i’m shunned.. worst moment i haven’t been sexually harassed or assaulted. i’m writing out of guilt for not doing more to stop a situation before it happened to someone else.the harasser was a graduate student in the same lab as me (i’m also a graduate student). he was a jerk for a long time before his behavior rose to the level of harassment. for example, he routinely sent long rambling emails criticizing junior female colleagues. he sent an email to the entire department after mandatory sexual harassment training saying it was “interesting” but maybe there were cultural differences that meant we should actually be ok with some of the behaviors the training called “harassment.”english wasn’t his first language so in these situations most of us gave him the benefit of the doubt, hoping we were misinterpreting what he was trying to say. one email included lyrics from a song which weren’t threatening, but the song was about someone going to school with a gun and shooting himself. a number of people reported it to hr. the email came late at night and i was glad i had to be away from campus the next day.this grad student published a lot and was close to our pi. the one time another grad student and i tried to talk to our pi about his behavior, our pi defended him by saying he’d had a difficult life. i never reported him to hr (and after a presentation by our school’s title ix officer focused on “win-win solutions,” i’m unlikely to bother with that route). he’d been furious at me for not asking how he was in an email once, so what would he do if he found out i’d made real trouble? i didn’t actually fear he’d be physically violent, but i was confident our pi would side with him in any dispute between us. i also thought maybe i was just being too sensitive (since then i’ve talked with other graduate students in our department; it wasn’t just me).the sexual harassment happened when he was supervising a younger researcher. i found out months after the fact that he expressed romantic interest in her that she did not reciprocate. in response, he reminded her our pi would believe whatever he said about the quality of her work in the lab (she was doing excellent work; the implication was that he would lie and say she wasn’t). it was a clear case of quid-pro-quo go out with me or their will be professional consequences.fortunately our pi believed her when she told him about the threat. unfortunately our pi kept the harasser in the lab until he graduated the next academic year. he‘s now doing a postdoc in europe.i haven’t reported this because our pi already knows about it, and i think the only person who might be harmed would be the woman who was harassed, who’s still pursuing a career in this field. i’m mad at myself. i wonder whether facing consequences for his less severe behaviors would have taught him to treat his trainee appropriately. i have given up on universities caring about anything other than their public image and the alumni dollars it brings. i’m afraid people in power will never really change things. this has cost me i’m ok. i do wonder what the young women in my department could have accomplished, in our research and our personal lives, with the time and energy we’ve been using to help each other deal with assholes. something you should know i naturally have a lot of compassion for other people and tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, even if we don’t get along. in hindsight, i think this is a huge reason why i didn’t report or do more to stop our lab’s harasser. i really bought into his claims that *he* was the real victim in these situations. is there a bright side things are changing. our department actually got rid of a sexual harasser last year. (different person than the one described above. the person who left was support staff, not an academic researcher, and sadly i think that’s the only reason he’s gone.) newer faculty members are much aware of these issues and receptive to what we have to say, and nearly all the grad students in our department are great people who are truly supportive of each other. i’m hopeful about the next generation of leaders. my fight song truth hurts by lizzo secret weapon my patience and my anger.. my worst moment i was a newly minted associate professor. an emeritus professor came up behind me at a public retirement party on campus, bent his knees, and humped me. and, yes, i was wearing a dress. this happened in front of other people and the response was about what you would expect. no one jumped in to rescue me, and no one seemed to have realized that i had just been assaulted. i was barely able to tell my therapist about the assault – sobbing the entire time over the phone. i was paralyzed for days, made even worse when my harasser came into my lab and put his arm around me – a gesture that had never occurred before. for several years, very few people knew what had happened to me. when i was promoted to professor, i felt more able to speak about what happened. i first wrote a few sentences in a blog post describing the incident although it took me days to post. eventually, i filed a title ix complaint. the process is awful – i cannot express strongly enough how stressful and triggering the investigative process can be, and the lack of any emotional support is a very real problem with the system. the investigation clearly documented that the sexual harassment was real and physical. i have given up on convincing my department head that saying my harasser’s name in front of me or writing emails to me that contain his name is absolutely triggering, unacceptable, and unnecessary. i’m afraid that my harasser will show up at my home. he has already come by twice and tried to speak to me when i happened to be in the yard. i filed police reports both times, but they can only ask him not to talk to me. this has cost me hours and hours and hours of therapy, sleepless nights, probably several papers and grants because my mind was occupied with processing a trauma. i am still waiting to see what else this event and the complaint may cost me professionally. something you should know about me i really like data, i want to see all of my students succeed, and i find unethical behavior on the part of my colleagues absolutely grating. i also have two dogs, two cats, and a tortoise. my fight song is there a song out there called “please just leave me alone, already?” my secret weapon therapy, my spouse, cuddles with my kid and pets, and social media. feel free to ping me on twitter (@geoedresearch) and here’s my bloghttps//geocognitionresearchlaboratory.wordpress.commy worst moment my worst moments were in my first year graduate student office. the male students viewed it as a frat house, not a workspace. they would vocally rank the female grad students in attractiveness, one spent a day yelling vagina every time a female student walked into the room, another started stalking some of the male graduate students after taking a scissors to someone’s hand. when the last offense was reported, the male students were told “that’s just the way mathematicians are” and none of the women felt comfortable coming forward. julie declined to post a photo. i completed graduate school, but then walked away from math and switched fields. i have given up on of how many women leave math because of the hostile environments created by classmates. i’m afraid by switching fields, i am currently 4 years behind many of my colleagues from graduate school who continued on to tenure-track positions in the same field. i estimate being at reduced rank, i’ve lost at least $200k in wages. this has cost me i am a passionate advocate for and dedicated mentor to women in science. i am grateful for all the support i received in switching fields and view it as my personal obligation to pay it forward. something you should know about me i was able to be successful in a new field, with colleagues and research topics that i absolutely adore. is there a bright side let it go (maybe it’s because my 3 year old forced that on me). my fight song yoga and online peer support networks.. my worst moment i was subject to sexual harassment from a senior staffer (e.g. inappropriately intimate questioning, groping) as a technician at an institute in the usa. i did nothing about it. i needed a reference. i experienced gender discrimination from my supervisor as a phd student in the uk (e.g. “i’m helping john and james find a postdoc, you have a husband to look after you”). i did nothing. i needed a reference. i experienced gender violation from 2 male colleagues while working at a remote field site as a postdoc at a university in australia. i did nothing, i was too embarrassed to. as a senior researcher at an institute in australia i was regularly mistaken for a tea lady, talked over the top of, informed i was not “leadership material”, provided less resources than more junior male colleagues despite bringing in more grant funding, not invited to collaborate with the blokes, had my work plagiarized and my projects taken away from me and given to male colleagues. i did not have a “worst moment” i had 2 years of complete hell when i finally decided i would make a complaint. i became the target of a sustained attack on my person and my reputation by the male “superstar” in the lab who had built his career off my back but easily convinced the boys club that comprised department heads that i was “high maintenance”, “hysterical” and a troublemaker. i have given up on my brilliant career. i’m afraid frequently. this has cost me several million dollars in lost wages, years wasted trying to cope with ptsd, depression, anxiety, my relationship, many friends, the opportunity to use my skills to make a difference in the world. is there a bright side no. the way things are, encouraging young women into science is like sending lambs to the slaughter. so, no. it has to change. something you should know about me i discovered i had other skills and graduated top of the class in law. i got a belated letter of apology from the institute in question which made me feel slightly better until i realised that their assurances that they have improved their processes have not stopped what happened to me continuing to other women at that institution. i’m determined that this stops. and i am now a lawyer. secret weapon looking like someone men underestimate. my worst moment oh boy, it’s a toss-up.i was stalked and sexually harassed by a supervisor and, when i reported it and presented facebook messages as proof, the manager laughed and said she just couldn’t see him doing something like that. nothing about his work situation was changed even though he was doing the same to other employees and i was told, in no unclear terms, by our manager to not speak about it because he didn’t want me to. i was told that if i really couldn’t handle working with him, then i could move to a different position, which would have cost me the promotion i was working towards. he still works there. all the girls he harassed are long gone.i have a bachelor’s degree in management of information systems and am currently working on my master’s degree in information systems with a focus in it security. i’m not an idiot. but i was told by a male engineer once to go make a salad while he worked because “ladies are better at that sort of thing”. on another, my supervisor went on a long rant (to me, of all people) about how his son couldn’t fine a job in engineering because women are getting in easier as equal opportunity hires. i wanted so badly to tell him that maybe his son shouldn’t be in the bottom 13% of the male hiring pool, but i didn’t.i let my academic adviser talk me out of staying in the computer science program and instead transferred to mis on her advice because “there’s less math in that major”. i was halfway through a math minor at the time. my math skills were more than up to scruff. i have given up on taking people’s advice or letting their opinions shape mine. i struggle with self-confidence, especially because i came into this field much later than many of my colleagues, and i have always had issues with staying confident in my opinions. there must be something about my overall look that tells people that i must be someone who absolutely needs my opinions and ideals bashed and questioned because it seems to never end. but, i’m learning, albeit slowly, how to stand my ground and decide things for myself. i have given up on allowing people to bully me into decisions. i’m afraid i’m afraid that i made the wrong choice in career. i’m afraid that i won’t be happy or fulfilled…or that i’ll end up working for another misogynist or woman who laughs at sexual harassment and stalking charges. this has cost me bits of sanity, nights of sleep, self-confidence, a job (when it became too awkward to work with a man who was stalking me and trying to get nudes from another coworker), etc. definitely the cost of switching majors halfway through a degree. i can’t begin to calculate this. the worst for me was having to be afraid of leaving work at night because i was terrified that my stalker would be waiting for me. something you should know about me i didn’t choose stem. i was told from an early age by my very strict parents that stem disciplines were the only ones worthwhile, so i worked to become top of my class in all of these fields. actually, computer science was the only subject that my high school didn’t offer and i didn’t even own my own computer until college (my parents were very against sitting in front of screens). my dream has always been to write and illustrate my own books. but this career path was practical and it irks my parents while also finally meeting their expectations and making them proud. i just hope i have enough time in this world to both be successful in my field and achieve my dream. i’m working every day to achieve both. is there a bright side the bright side is, i’ve been lucky enough to make extraordinary friends during my time in it. i now work with a brigade of people who would come to my aid if i ever encountered the same situations that i found myself in before. not everyone is a bad apple. don’t let them ruin the bunch for you. my fight song a day to remember – have faith in me secret weapon the thought that a girl who had never owned a computer could, within the space of a few short, turmoil-filled years, become competition to people who had been immersed in technology their whole lives. it’s a pretty good thought.. worst moment i came back from maternity leave and a collaborator with a busy schedule immediately set a meeting with me. at first, this seemed like a lucky break, but i quickly learned that meeting wasn’t to discuss my manuscript. this collaborator needed to tell me something that couldn’t have a paper trail.my supervisor was telling everyone that he was disappointed in me because of work left unfinished while i was on leave. i had gone on sick leave very early because i went into labor at 32 weeks. i spent days trying to stop my labor, had a complicated delivery followed by weeks in the nicu.i was hard to get a hold of because i spent my days cuddling & trying to nurse a 3 pound infant. despite science backing my actions, i was being judged for not responding to emails, or giving up my few hours of sleep to finish manuscripts.bottom line, instead of having support during a difficult time, i was getting trash talked as a lazy and unfocused trainee. people will stop collaborating with me, because of what my old supervisor had told them about my work ethic. i have given up on i’m not even sure yet… how do you quantify the collaborator emails that never come? i’m afraid i make really great espresso brownies. this has cost me i have learned that mama bear mode is very real. something you should know baby shark is there a bright side the whisper network is starting to close in.. my worst moment when my colleague tried to kiss me. i have given up on my peace, health, trust. i’m afraid nothing cause i’m not at fault. this has cost me future career, effected my work quality. something you should know about me i was working as a phd student, i was friendly but in moderation. the postdoc would be the head in behaviour neuroscience and i was new to this field as i was from molecular biology. i asked him to show me the way to extract the data, the data was on the computer which was in a soundproof room behind the animal holding room. they are all over in extreme right side of the building. we all knew it’s all sealed and access was limited. i asked him to help me with the data retrieval, then i realized he was coming onto me. i got so scared, i tried to put all my energy and scream at the top of my voice. asked him to leave. he behaved as if i was the culprit and he was the victim. after that day i had a week of shivers just at the thought of going to the unit. also i was in self doubt, if it happened or not. i ignored him and engrossed myself in work. this was detrimental for me, it was my coping mechanism. then if any male tried working close to me it would scare me, thinking what happened. then i ignored when my supersion was off at his sabbatical, he would start bullying me and say what if i kiss you now, you won’t do anything. i replied him back, he said why i don’t ask for his help, how he doubted my data? all his intentions were to hurt me to maximum, to make me feel vulnerable. when i refuse to give in, he was getting more aggressive and threatening me that he won’t let me finish my phd. is there a bright side he went to the extent of calling me crazy for my complaints and when i stood against him. i was confident that he was wrong and that stood with me. i took him out and told him, i ignored you so you learn from your mistake. if he won’t stop i don’t mind my phd, but will make sure he doesn’t have a career after that. i had enough evidence against his harassment. my fight song we are the champions – queen secret weapon parents, faith in myself.. my worst moment when a colleague tried to insist that i sleep with him to prove i wasn’t gay. in public, in front of other colleagues and students. i have given up on not much, to be honest. fuck ‘em. i’m afraid that my daughter might be confronted with the same shit i had to deal with. this has cost me i got the hell out of that job/university placement into a different one, which paid better etc. have been very careful and protective of my students (grad and undergrad) and don’t let them get in situations like this if i can help it. something you should know about me grew up in a very rural small town, hate conflict, tend to take things too personally. is there a bright side i’m a full professor, president of my (big) professional society, considered a big deal. i’m at a r1 but low status university. don’t let where you land determine what you aspire to do. my fight song tub thumping “when i fall down, i get up again…” secret weapon dogged determination. i know from my background i’m disadvantaged. wanted to nonetheless prove i could “play.”. my worst moment multiple panic attacks, paranoia, always following other interns around, never staying alone, never stargazing again, being afraid to come to work every day, feeling worthless. other interns noticing this interns weird and disgusting behavior towards me, and doing nothing. having been told it’s my fault for talking to him politely. hiding from him for two hours in a room. crying and running to escape in front of senior researchers and even, panicked, considering jumping out of the window then not doing it. i have given up on expecting male interns and researchers to treat me as a human being. waiting for help from other people. i’m afraid to ever meet him again or ending up in the same field. this has cost me $ $400 something you should know about me declined to answer is there a bright side it only lasted 1 month, with this man being rude and unprofessional for about 2 weeks. my fight song foals – two steps, twice secret weapon rage. my worst moment i met a very “prestigious” man at the nih at a conference. after chatting briefly, he excused himself to the restroom and drunkenly told my colleague (who he didn’t know knew me) that he was going to have sex with me and my female colleague (this was a social event where nearly everyone had drinks). it never would have happened. but. i also never would have known he was bragging about “me” if this colleague didn’t tell me. how unknowingly embarrassing it’d be for my entire field to assume i slept with this “higher up” for my personal gain. i steer clear at every conference i see him at. i also clearly remember hearing him say “what happens at [conference] stays at [conference].” he’s married with kids. and abusing his power at the nih. i have given up on trusting many “respected” men in science. i’m afraid false rumors will ruin my career. this has cost me emotional health is priceless. something you should know about me i’ve met more abusive, discriminatory, predatory men than i can even believe. and i’m not that old. i can only imagine how many more i’ll encounter in my career during my lifetime. is there a bright side people are finally standing up and making noise about this issue. maybe we don’t have to wait for “this generation of white men to die” before something changes.. my worst moment going though the whole complaints process, only to find that the university couldn’t tell me what action they’d taken. the man i’d complained about is still working there, so i doubt anything has been done. if he wasn’t a professor, if he was a care worker or a bus driver, he never would’ve worked again after what he did. i’ve been left feeling disillusioned and angry. i have given up on having a career in academia. i’m afraid his behavior will be allowed to continue. perhaps the next woman won’t be as resilient as i am. this has cost me i’ve no idea what the financial cost has been. it’s changed my dreams. something you should know i’m not a wimp. is there a bright side i can see that the emperor’s got no clothes on and laugh at him. middle class people put academics up on a pedestal, but they’re no different to navvies. i never had much respect for authority, but that’s gone. i’m off to be my own boss. my fight song cigarettes and alcohol by oasis [youtube] secret weapon my family.. my worst moment holding my chest in shock and terrified in the elevator, still feeling his impact on my breast like it was happening over and over again repeatedly but yet still confused that it maybe didn’t happened at all because these things shouldn’t happen, especially at work. trying to convince myself after repeated harassment and assault, to just let it go, that reporting it would just make things worse and i didn’t ever want him to know that he scared me, because i knew that was what he wanted, to put a strong confident successful queer woman ‘in her place’. i have given up on feeling like anyone at the university would understand or actually help. i gave up on feeling safe at work and even gave up on the fact that that was not ok. i have given up on justice – that there will be any consequences for his actions. i’m afraid every day at work, every time i hear a noise, turn a corner, the elevator doors open, i open a door, walk into a room, go in to the bathroom alone and think this is it, he has finally snapped and is going to kill me and still nothing will be done except some professional cold email will be sent out from the department about how ‘sorry they are for the loss.’ this has cost me $2,000, have avoided all departmental meetings to the detriment of my career. something you should know about me i am persistent, i do not give up, and i speak up for what is not right – but this form of harassment, intimidation, and assault is insidious and convinces you that ‘it’s not worth reporting’, that ‘you probably misunderstood’, and he’ll win if you let him see how much he’s hurt and scared you. i kept quiet for 4 years, do not make my mistake, speak up and out. we have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us well- time’s up. is there a bright side i kept complaining when it got so bad i was going to quit right after i defended my phd and leave some projects unfinished –i’d rather be out of this nightmare than have a higher impact paper. my advisor stepped in as a strong advocate. she said it would be a failure of the university for me to leave like this and demanded change. he is now banned from the floors i work on and i feel safer. the bright side came when people not only believed me, but too action as an ally. i just had to invoke my power, speak loudly and clearly, and realize there is no weakness in reporting it and no shame in fighting for your rights. my fight song ‘i’ll make a man out of you’ from the mulan soundtrack- reminds me why the fight is worth it and the ceaseless strength and power inside every woman that is suppressed by oppression. secret weapon network of allies who are reshaping our field and dedicated to speaking up for what is right.. my worst moment when people i loved and respected didn’t stand up for me or understand my brokenness around this. i don’t trust and love recklessly like i once did. i am very cautious with my all parts of my heart and my boundaries. on assuming there is someone who is coming to help me. i honestly thought college administrators were letting this crazy person run me down to collect enough information on what he was doing to fire him. i was stupid. my college ‘passed the trash’ to another university. the administration then hired a faculty member around the same time and now he’s (quietly, of course!) being investigated for assault. the press isn’t coming to help you. the department of justice isn’t coming to help you. your faculty senate isn’t coming and neither is your national association of scientists. i have given up he’ll kill me. i’m afraid roughly $200,000 personally and professionally about $5,000,000. this has cost me i’m funnier than you are. something you should know nobody in my department invites me to meetings anymore! is there a bright side white flag my fight song i have unedited transcripts of his testimony and the testimony of other faculty members about him. their words will be so much more powerful than anything i could say.. my worst moment was the high of having someone in the field of astro and physics speak to me, an actual scientist working for nasa, an educator and the closest i would ever come to my dreams of space offer me an opportunity to join him on an expedition, only to realize by his complete impropriety that he was just another man who couldn’t care less about me or my aspirations but only his desires and urges. i have given up on admiring people, these days i try to only respect the work and even then it’s extremely hard. i’m afraid that because he is a revered scientist i will be harassed, that people won’t believe me, that everyone will think i am speaking attention from his fame or that he will say to others that it was all me trying to get to him. this has cost me it has cost me the ability to trust that i can say yes to going away into things like expeditions and not be taken advantage of, it has traumatized meinto believing that someday i will inevitably have to make a choice between doing the things i love in science by submitting myself to men’s desires or walk away from it and closing doors for myself. something you should know about me i have already endured many kinds of abuses, yet i had managed to maintain that part of dream that dreams of better things, that dreams of being a part of a supportive scientific environment in which i can thrive. is there a bright side i suppose the bright side would be that now i know better than to let my childhood dreams blind my true perception of people in science. my fight song “dance while you shoot”. my worst moment i decided to take time off from grad school to be a technician and got a job right away. i had to move to another city 3 hours away. after starting there, the new pi started getting very verbally and emotionally abusive. he would question me about the smallest details and accused me of scientific misconduct. he also would call at 11 pm and 1 am wondering why i did not fix my “mistakes”. he said in an email that i had a brain pathology, i was a “dumb f**k”, and after only 2 weeks threatened to complain to hr because i was not getting the results he expected. i wanted to organize the lab and he screamed at me for an hour and subsequently told another person in the lab to do it. he then became extremely micromanaging to the point where he wanted to know how long it took me to go to the bathroom and back. he would scream at me over the phone for not responding to his email within a literal 2 minutes. he expected me to work 60+ hours and only paid me for 40+. i was there in that lab for three months. everyone knows about his behavior in the department, but very little has been done. i meeting new people and faith in humanity. i have lost a lot of weight from not eating appropriately. i have not wanted to go back to grad school, even though it was something i was planning on because i feel i was completely changed by the horrific experience. have given up on every time i see him in meetings and seminars. i’m afraid i felt like i made the wrong decision of leaving grad school and should’ve returned. i had to get a second and third job to help sustain myself and went into chronic debt by moving. i was not making enough to get health insurance and i have noticed my health severely decline and continue the vicious cycle of working 60+ hours a week and not enough money or time to fix my emotional health. this has cost me i have wanted to be scientist for ever and i loved how in science you get to think critically and the method of discovery was awesome. i have always been a good judge of character and my “radar sensors” failed me. something you should know moved to another lab and thriving. i am very slowly recovering emotionally, but still might not go back to graduate school. is there a bright side anything by good charlotte [youtube link] my fight song my professionalism. my worst moment being myold self. i have given up that someday i’ll stop being strong enough to keep fighting. i’m afraid i won’t give up. i’m too stubborn for that. this has cost me nonstop (hamilton). well, basically all of hamilton. something you should know about me god. couldn’t have made it through the past two years without my faith.dear reader, i am praying for you.. my worst moment i’m in germany and don’t have a lot of places to turn. my school is very rich and powerful. the head of the school interviewed all my witnesses and terrified them into silence or lying. he even told one of my male witnesses that i was accusing him of sexual harassment when i did not. so, that witness turned on me. a woman i thought was my friend also turned on me. i was suicidal for awhile after that happened. i sometimes get caught up too much wondering what it must feel like to be the man who sexually harassed me. what does it feel like to humiliate someone and get away with it? i was even told he’s done it before to another woman. what does that feel like? to be so awful and have people stand up for you? i tried to do what was right and everyone disappeared. i have given up on people telling the truth during a workplace investigation. i’ve also given up on all workplace investigations. legally, an investigation must be done quickly and confidentially. but, beyond that, there are no additional laws regulating how it must be conducted. the fact that the head of the school could lead the investigation is sick to me. it should have been an unbiased investigator with no conflict of interest. i’m afraid of victim blaming. also, my career feels dead. i don’t know what to do next. this has cost me i didn’t get my contract renewed. i was told, “members of my department don’t think i’m happy.” i can’t imagine a man losing a job because he isn’t happy enough. clearly, i didn’t smile enough and act demure and sweet like a woman should. my legal feels are €2500 so far. i have no idea what job to do next as i am too brokenhearted and have ptsd so i can’t continue teaching. i anticipate 1-2 years of lost income. something you should know about me i’m a stem high school science teacher. this didn’t occur in a university. there was an incredible amount of sexist attitudes held by my male science teacher colleagues. i believe this has an impact on the female students at the school, negatively impacting their interest and confidence in stem subjects. is there a bright side i’m suing my school so it’s hard for me to see a bright side right now. but, i hold on to the hope that my standing up for myself might make a difference to someone else. my fight songs wild hearts can’t be broken – pink quiet – milck roar – katy perry sound of surviving – nichole nordeman my secret weapon my husband and my son.. my worst moment at a departmental happy hour, i was afraid the men who i feared would show up. i was talking with a male peer, and he expressed he wished there was something he could do. he has seen these issues throughout the department during his time in the program, and he has told me horror stories about other women’s struggles. it was then that i realized there was nothing that i could do – my voice was ignored, my department didn’t support me, and my advisor didn’t value my safety. i have given up on everything. i had to leave my program after months of chronic stress, anxiety, and sleep deprivation. i felt barely human when i left. i’m afraid that this trend will continue – that i will be asked to change my behavior to accommodate the men who make me feel unsafe, rather than asking these men to change their behavior at all. this has cost me $20,000 – lost income, opportunity, cost of therapy and health care. something you should know about me i had to go through my department’s title ix process previously, and it resulted in no action. i reported to my advisor that i felt unsafe in lab several times and he did nothing. other women in my department have reported the same to their advisors, with similar or worse results (ex – a female higher up in our department told one of their students to “keep quiet or it’ll ruin her career”). at this point, i am angry and tired of being silenced. i want my voice to be heard. is there a bright side i found a job at a university which has a program that will be better for me in many aspects! my fight song non-stop from alexander hamilton, the musical [youtube link] secret weapon my friends – they can speak up for me when i am paralyzed with fear.. my worst moment being cornered in a violent manner in my office by my male superior. i have given up on the university i wanted to work at. i’m afraid no this has cost me thousands of dollars in overtime owed to me. something you should know about me i’m not going to give up. is there a bright side i found my voice. my fight song a walk through hell—say anything [youtube link] my secret weapon my tenacity.. my worst moment i was a postdoc in a competitive lab and in a competitive field. in the last year of my postdoc, i was assaulted by another labmate at the department’s annual science retreat. i had never been much of a drinker so a glass of wine can last me the entire night. i watched everyone else around me get drunk; it was getting late and that’s when i headed back to my room. my labmate was walking closely behind and when i got to my room i heard “wait up.” as i opened my door that is when i was pushed into my room and assaulted. i thought the assault was my worst moment, but it was the actions of the department and university that were the most devastating. my advisor told me that it was a personal issue, the department chair did not think it was their problem, and the university referred me back to the department. nothing was ever resolved. i have given up on during this time, i was in the process of applying for faculty positions. i could not focus on doing what it takes to get the job proposal together. i had given up on putting together an outstanding job application. i had given up on coming into lab. and i had given up on interacting with my colleagues because i was so hurt that someone i know was capable of such a bad thing. i’m afraid because my job proposals were mediocre at best, i was afraid to submit anything. i had given up on my dream of being a principal investigator. i was afraid that i would never be heard or believed about my assault. something you should know about me i am currently a senior faculty member. i sought out different mentors during my postdoc who not only encouraged me to still apply for faculty positions, but also actively promoted my career. is there a bright side people are now listening. there are more advocates for you and your career than when i was starting. my fight song coat of many colors by dolly parton [youtube link] secret weapon ignore that inner voice that tells you that you can’t.. my worst moment when i fully realized and accepted that he was not a mentor, career sponsor or even a friend but a serial predator, that i had just been a toy to him, and worst of all he was doing it to someone else. i wanted to kill myself. i have given up on vindicating myself to his supporters, given up on projects and unwritten manuscripts that remind me of that time, doubting myself and feeling guilty i’m afraid he will kill me or kill my children. this has cost me despite having shakey confidence, feeling worthless and hopeless, i found some sort of inner strength to persist. i found my voice and went through all the hr steps to file a complaint even though everyone said nothing would change. i got organized. i compiled the evidence. i wrote down the names of witnesses and above all i never let go of my inner truth of being a good person who hadn’t deserved the harassment. i won. he was fired. something you should know about me yes. there is fulfillment in seeing a process through and restoration in hope that comes from the official finding of harassment and exposing what he did to me. and the bright side is that he is gone. is there a bright side roar by katy perry my fight song strength in representation. i represent all women of color who are statistically more likely to face harassment and statistically less likely to confront these problems. my inner strength was harnessed when i felt the responsibility of representation.. my worst moment when i went to my supervisor to discussinappropriate advances of a male colleague, they told me that i should use my female ‘characteristics’ at work and get better papers. i have given up on collaborating with a promising because all the male participants were constantly defaming female colleagues. i am afraid i will have my name and career destroyed by them. this has cost me apost-doc position and numerous co-author papers. something you should know about me i’m planning on leaving academia. is there a bright side to know that i am not alone. my fight song kozmic blues. my worst moment letting this one incident define me. i am an amazing scientist and that one moment will not take away my career and my future. i have given up on that his will happen to someone else. my incident was not a faculty or staff member. it was a fellow student, and it still has lasting effect. i’m afraid i am strong, and he did not stop me. i am getting my phd despite the hoops i had to jump through. something you should know about me kick boxing class!. my worst moment trying to refuse the advances of my second rapist by sharing the story of my first, only for him to ask me to advertise to my department that his dick was bigger. i have given up on seeking retribution. there is nothing that can be done to them to make up for the damage to my confidence and well-being. undergoing the title ix complaint process was exhausting and unfulfilling. i’m afraid these perpetrators will never be stopped. at least one plans to gain a ph.d. in hopes of teaching at a primarily undergraduate institution for the benefit of “heavy student interaction.” this has cost me a $50k/yr job offer right out of undergrad- i wouldn’t work where i had been assaulted. i moved on to grad school, because i thought academia would be better. i pay $2,000 a year for therapy and antidepressants, and will be taking a job outside of the academy after finishing my program. something you should know about me i told myself none of this wouldn’t stop me from getting my degree. it hasn’t yet. my fight song “had enough,” lower than atlantis my secret weapon a wonderfully supportive network of lab mates, an impossibly patient so, and a kick-ass therapist.. my worst moment being injured by children throwing rocks at my tent when i was homeless, just days after returning from the united states, where some people were supposedly ‘helping’ me with my theoretical physics career. i have given up on low self-esteem. i’m afraid not afraid of anything now. absolutely nothing. once you learn to stare the beast in the face and return the fire, you are a warrior. this has cost me estimate of lost salary 30 years as a senior professor on an average of usd100000 per year (not including other perks) = usd 3 million.health costs premature aging estimate = 30 years (following studies on homelessness); failures of a biased medical system resulting in (temporary) brain damage from severe malnutrition, long term cognitive difficulties due to depression and anxiety; health problems due to torture, cyberabuse and psychological abuse include anxiety, stress, paranoia, psychosis, fatigue, pain, chronic insomnia, visual impairment and vertigo.lost opportunites the university of oxford lost the opportunity to support and employ one of the world’s leading brilliant theoretical physicists. universities in new zealand and australia lost the opportunity to learn about the problems of academic mobbing from an experienced target. private research think tanks lose opportunities constantly by ignoring studies that show how diversity increases productivity (duh). something you should know about me i figured out in 2017 how quantum inertia justifies the neutrino cmb mass correspondence. this revolutionises cosmology, and brings wonderful insights into the new motivic approach to quantum gravity. is there a bright side i’m still here! and i know more than i did before. my fight song i hear their mocking laughter, every time i forgivefor they think that forgiveness is weaknessthey do not know that their power is an illusionthat arrogance, bigotry and greed have already had their daythat they can never make us hate them in return, because our hearts do not work that wayand one day soon, when everyone really knows what they have done, it is to us that they will turn for help, because they will be widely shunnedby a world that believed their lies secret weapon love and truth.. my worst moment finding out my boss wanted to fire me (after he sexually assaulted me) because i would not sleep with him and that not a single surgeon in the department who knew thought such behavior warranted any serious action more then “yelling at him.” i have given up on going to graduate school for public health to pursue a career in research. after experiencing such pervasive harassment in my twenties when i was just beginning a career in medicine, my perception of the field changed drastically enough that i lost the desire to pursue a career in it. i’m afraid that nothing will change and prominent surgeons in academia at my institution will continue this behavior and more women will be demoralized and leave medicine, thus causing a continuation of the environment. this has cost me after coming forward to title ix, the severe retaliation and continued harassment forced me to resign and the only position open was a part time job, so my salary was cut by 50% from 56,000 to 28,000. it also left me depressed and severely emotionally traumatized when my institution continued to support a known perpetrator who harassed numerous women and chose to discredit and smear me so as to delegitimize my claims, rather than hold my harasser accountable. maryland has been forced to actually respond to the allegations and even though they deny everything and continue to evade responsibility, they are at least forced to acknowledge our complaints. is there a bright side i decided to publicly share my story and more women are now coming forward. it’s the one thing that has made all the pain worth it – opening the door for women who have also been victimized to speak up.https//www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-um-sexual-harrassment-20180919-story.htmlhttps//www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-maryland-sexual-harassment-20181114-story.html something you should know about me rihanna and cardi b all day my fight song chicken fingers and reading roxane gay. my worst moment the worst moment happened just after he grabbed me and kissed me. i slapped him, and i was immediately afraid that i would be fired; but instead, he told me that he picked me because i was spunky, he knew i would fight back, and he likes firecrackers. i was lucky – when he lunged for me again, i was able to get away.but it wasn’t the actual physical interaction that was the worst; the worst moment was when i thought that i had let this happen to me. over the years i had internalized so many comments and “accidental” touching, and it had happened so many times, from several people over the years. but they were just words, and i told myself to ignore them. i had become so inured to this culture, that i told myself it was normal.over the years, i had colleagues comment on my looks and my body – all in front of other colleagues, who either laughed or sat silently, without speaking up for me. i was told i was only invited to certain meetings to sit and look pretty, not to speak. i had someone play a screensaver of naked women on the computer monitor behind him as he interviewed me. i had someone grab my ass while i was interviewing for a different job. i had someone stare at my chest the entire time i was interviewing him for a job (he was offered a job, despite my protestations). i was told i couldn’t report to someone, because he was a known predator and they wanted to minimize our interactions. (instead, he decided it was okay to prey on me, because i didn’t report to him.) i was told a senior employee was supporting me not because he thought i was a good scientist, but because he wanted to sleep with me. i found out that different colleagues were alleging to other colleagues that they had slept with me. these incidents may have been the most hurtful, because some of the colleagues who were alleging these things had been nothing but professional to my face. and of course, this was accompanied by the realization that the men were all talking about me behind my back.the worst moment isn’t a single point in time, but the realization that this isn’t about a single physical incident. we need to recognize that sexual harassment isn’t just about physical assault, but the culture. i have given up on trusting my coworkers. i’m afraid the culture will never change. this has cost me i couldn’t collaborate with certain people, and i couldn’t work after hours because i was afraid of being caught alone with these people, so i missed out on a lot of interesting projects. i changed jobs a few times. when i did tell hr about the physical incident, they offered to transfer me to another site across the country. i’m not sure how to quantify that loss. something you should know about me i’m still angry. is there a bright side i eventually found a new career that i love. secret weapon my keyboard.. worst moment it is really hard to choose one particular moment, as my phd was a nightmare almost every day for 5 years due to constant threats and uncivil behavior from my supervisor. i should point out that i was never a victim of sexual harassment – i was a victim of harassment the demeaning attitude, aggressive pressure and insidious intimidation that arise from the abuse of power over others.perhaps one of the most memorable moments (many of which i unconsciously repressed) happened shortly after i started my phd. i had been working for several days structuring a figure panel on an extremely non-intuitive program i had never heard of and that i had to learn all by myself. my supervisor demanded that all results were shown to him on that particular format on a weekly basis and that day had arrived. after looking at my work with contempt, he printed the file, ripped the paper in front of my eyes and said “this? this is crap”. after that, he tossed the paper pieces to the trash bin violently, as if i had done the worst thing in the world. what came next was a conversation (more of a monologue, really) on how i should change my behavior, otherwise i would be replaced by one of the hundreds of students who would abide by his rules and appreciate the opportunity of working under him. he also mentioned (displaying his fingers very close to my face) that i was “this close” – to what i didn’t understand, but i assumed he was talking about me being kicked out of his lab. his threats were always present throughout my phd, and i became the “little mouse who freezes in the corner of the cage”, always trying to keep away from conflict situations.every day before our scheduled weekly meetings (or the spontaneous ones) i would feel sick. my constant state of anxiety and fear led to panic attacks and by the end, while writing my thesis, it culminated in me having to spend a week in a hospital bed. when i returned to the lab, he told me my thesis was bad but that we should stop trying to improve it because i was weak and couldn’t handle the pressure.i presented several formal complaints along the years to my thesis committee, to the direction of the institute and to other pis who knew very well my supervisor’s reputation and all the other careers he ruined. as he is one of the few people with a permanent contract with the institute and a powerful position, the answer was always the same “you were warned; there is nothing we can do about it. it was your responsibility.” i’ve learned during my phd that nothing protects a student from unscrupulous supervisors, fearful thesis committees and complacent direction board members. i have given up on i have given up on fighting for a career as a scientist. at a certain point during my phd, my work was about to be submitted to a prestigious journal. for some reason, my supervisor decided he didn’t want to publish it. instead, what was supposed to be my only first author publication ended up on a drawer and it will never be published, which lowers a lot my chances of pursuing a career in science – even if i really wanted one. even though i never asked for any recommendation from him for any of the jobs i took after my phd, he takes every opportunity to actively sabotage my career progression. i’m afraid i’m afraid to put myself in a position that would make me vulnerable again to the abuse i’ve suffered during my phd. this has cost me my dream career – the one i’ve been fighting for all my adult life. it has also cost me the opportunity to collaborate, to go to scientific conferences, to publish and the chance to have built a good cv. it has cost me my physical and mental health, which years later i am still trying to recover. in monetary terms, it has cost me two months working on my thesis without a salary. after 10 years working in academia, i find myself without publications, a career in science or savings in a bank account. something you should know i am a people person, an extrovert, someone who needs human interaction to feel fulfilled. i believe in cooperation and teamwork as much as i believe tolerance and kindness are key for interpersonal dynamics.being a lover of the horror genre has helped me cope with anxiety and fear in real life. is there a bright side the bright side of having been pushed out of academia is to have found my vocation in education and a job i love. every day i get to think about what me, my colleagues and close friends have been through under the tyranny of the academic system and to come up with ideas on how to transform the academic environment into a richer and more pleasant one. i have converted my personal frustrations into energy that propels me to find ways to fight for respect and dignity and against harassment and abuse. i also get to meet and talk to a lot of brilliant scientists and future scientists, and to those i dedicate my efforts to change the academic system for the better. my fight songs secret weapon everyone tells me that i look austere and serious. to be honest, that is an outside armor i use to protect myself.. my worst moment i was a phd student in science, and i had been invited to participate in a summer school, where dozens of bright young minds would gather to network and to get a crash course in our field.it all happened at once at the end. one of the organizers, a professor in the field at a top institution, invited a friend of his (unrelated to the school) to join us onsite. the friend hounded us, especially focusing on recent comments made by another scientist about how women cannot be in the lab because they cry and fall in love with their mentors. he kept pushing the point, even getting in the hot tub with many of the students (male and female, all easily 20-25 years his junior). i and a few other women ended up having to leave, pushing us out of what should have been a useful networking opportunity.later that evening both of the men showed up on the porch where we were drinking and joined us. the professor offered to open up the “exclusive” bar onsite…because he didn’t think we were imbibing enough? then his friend started giving unwarranted and undesired massages (shoulders and *legs*) to all of the women, working his way down the couch. he didn’t reach me because of two people1) a woman at the event who was about to get (or had just gotten) married and announced that she didn’t feel threatened by him, making herself a target by choice.2) a man who was sitting next to me helped me out of beig cornered and took me to the other side of the patio. i have given up on 1) the school took place off campus, and the students were from all over the country. i don’t even know where to begin to report, especially considering…2) for the longest time i didn’t believe it was bad enough to report. it was just a couple creeps being creepy. i wasn’t assaulted, i wasn’t attacked, and i haven’t seen this professor again. i still struggle to submit this story because the other stories i know about are “worse”. i’m afraid trusting male professors in social settings. i now check every conference i go to making sure that the professor won’t be there. is there a bright side that my job search will be hampered because this professor will be on the hiring committee. i don’t even know if he remembers what he did. that is why i am scared of submitting a photo or using my name. i’m also terrified that by not reporting i have enabled this professor to continue harassing young women. my fight songs the man who pulled me out of the line is now my boyfriend. he is an ally, and has continued to support me through grad school.also i met some fantastic women at the school, who i believe i am closer to through this shared experience. we all have stories beyond this one night, and we’ve tried to keep each other safe and sane.. my worst moments there are four top ones that come to mind (limiting the scope to stem employment only, but these experiences could easily happen anywhere), at three different employers i’ve given up on my new colleague, an engineer, married with a daughter my age, one day while working late alone in the office snuck up behind me, grabbed me by the hair, licked the back of my neck and swirled his tongue in my ear. when i fought him and yelled to get off me, he looked annoyed and said, “what’s wrong with you? can’t you take a joke?”. i told my manager the next day. he said, “that sounds like an hr problem.” hr told me, “why don’t just try to get along with people, ok?”. they never even spoke to the engineer. my contract was almost up and i left without asking for renewal. i’m afraid in a staff meeting, my co-worker said he’d told me about a scheduling change, but i hadn’t been notified. i asked him to repeat the information, he said he shouldn’t have to since i was already told. i insisted i don’t know, let’s discuss it now, and he told me we need to speak in private immediately so we left the meeting to go to a private room. as soon as the door was closed, he exploded in anger screaming about how could i embarrass him in the meeting like that! he punched me in the face. a month later, a different co-worker karate kicked me in the neck when i tried to give him a mop and told him to clean the floor after he deliberately poured a cup of tea out on the floor of my office. the employer told me in both instances, “it’s your fault that he was angry. you should just apologize.” i said no. i got fired. this has cost me the new manager in our first one on one meeting, my new manager told me he, “can’t stand the look of my stupid face.” he also accused me of lying about my qualifications. when i told him i was ending our meeting because of his unprofessionalism and his comments were uncalled for, he responded that he’d never said those things, i’m a liar and i’m attacking him. when i told my director, he replied, “he never talks to me like that, are you sure that really happened? you probably just misunderstood.” in that one moment i lost all my credibility for the next four years until that manager left. he purposefully made my life hell for four years. the answer to every difficult question i asked him was either, “why are you so emotional today?” or, “you’ll never understand the answer anyway so i’m not going to bother wasting my time telling you.” or “what you don’t understand is…”. i ended up with less important assignments and was disenfranchised from participating in meetings and major projects, which ultimately stagnated my career. something you should know about me the manager described above made a misogynistic joke about me specifically and i called him out on it on the spot. he filed an official complaint about me in retaliation for not laughing at his joke. our director was brought in to mediate. the manager explained that he was just yelling stuff at random, he doesn’t know what the words he said even mean, and he doesn’t have control over what comes out of his mouth anyway, so it’s not fair to hold him accountable for what he says and does. everyone else should learn to work around it because it’s not possible for him to change. i insisted he can and should do better, but the director bought his story. the director told me, “men are up here, women are down here, that’s the way it is. that’s the way it is at (this company) and that’s the way it is at (our department). that will never change. you must accept this.” he told me that i need to accept my subordinate role, put up and shut up, or leave. if i have the audacity to complain to hr, don’t bother, just leave. i decided i don’t accept, but was picky about what job i should take next. both the manager and director left shortly afterwards so i’m glad i stuck this one out. is there a bright side competing for leadership and management roles in my career. i don’t get taken seriously no matter what i do. i realize i either work for myself, or market myself as a high level independent contributor. i’ve given up on the idea that human resources is for the benefit of employees and can help resolve employee disagreements. hr is there to serve to best interest of the company, and usually that means getting rid of complainers. i gave up on pursuing more education. i’ve been told by several people over the years, “if you get too much education, you’ll never find a good husband.” fight song i get a lot less support from other women than i think there should be, like competition for the attention of a male manager. whatever nonsense i reject to preserve my dignity, there’s always someone who’s happy to accept it in order to get ahead. i don’t want to sink to that level, but my resistance to take part makes me look like the uncooperative one who’s causing a problem, where my intention is actually to raise the level of professionalism. secret weapon i’ve ended up unemployed and even homeless to avoid harassment and assaults from particular coworkers. bouncing from one job to another to escape bad situations rather than moving towards something i want looks bad on a resume. it became difficult to find new employment and to get meaningful references. constantly changing employers means starting on the bottom rung of the ladder over and over with little chance to build a professional reputation.. my worst moment in my first scientist job out of graduate school my supervisor became violent, he would push me off sidewalks and down stairs, throw me into walls, grab my arm and squeeze it until i brusied and hit me. he would corner me in the office and say “you really need to learn how to get out of having your back to the wall”. when i’d walk to my car in the evening he would follow me into the parking garage, and pick me up and slap me despite my screaming for him to put me down. one evening he followed me into the kitchen pushed me up against the counter and bent me backwards i was terrified he was going to rape me. i pleaded with him to let me go and he finally did. he told me that he could destroy me professionally if i told anyone and the only one i needed to keep happy was him because he would be writing my performance reviews and giving my recommendations. i stopped eating, stopped talking to friends and family and became completely isolated. i have given up on any hope for a future for me as a scientist. i felt embarrassed, humiliated and ashamed. i’m afraid that the same thing will happen to other young female scientists. that i won’t respond differently if the same scenario presented itself again. this has cost me mental health conseling, i had to move because he knew where i lived. i wasn’t forced to quit my job but the trauma associated with the workplace led me to quit. something you should know about me these experiences profoundly changed how i approached science and my role within it. people outside of our profession have no idea how much of our heart we pour into our work i felt like my world was upside down. is there a bright side in retrospect the experience made me a more resilient and more empathic person and motivated me to be purposeful and intentional with my time to use it to serve others. my field is still male dominated and the healing from the experience equipped me with good skills for working with men. my fight song the fear by the score [youtube link] secret weapon crossfit, powerlifting, and running. while exercise does not replace mental health therapy it is an excellent supplement.. my worst moment there are many, but one of the worst was when my pi would come to the laboratory and start guessing the bra size of all of his female students and postdocs. during a dinner in which i was introducing the lab to my boyfriend (now my husband), my pi engaged in a ‘game’ that involved asking everyone around the table with whom we would have sex from that group of people. i have given up on teaching people how to pronounce my name and not butcher it, teaching people that one can be a good scientist and a good human being, teaching people that the fact that you care doesn’t disqualify you from publishing impactful papers, teaching people that condescending attitudes do not mean mentoring. i’m afraid … that it is too late for our male graduate students to learn how to interact in an equitable and respectful way with everyone in stem.i’m afraid that sexual harassers in stem will continue to be well funded and lauded.i’m afraid that the response will be unequal and there would be pockets of no accountability and immunity for this behavior. this has cost me i suffer from a chronic condition that could have been triggered by rape. i lose a lot of work days because of this condition. i have been in therapy for 24 years in three different countries, four different cities and pay for it out of pocket (~100,000 dollars total). standing up for equity gives me the label of ‘troublemaker’. i never get selected for leadership positions (2 out of 2 times i put my name out there). something you should know about me i am the only one in my family with a college degree (let alone a phd). i am pathologically optimistic and find the bright side on every single experience. i am a black belt in karate and i am a pretty darn good singer. is there a bright side yes! this conversation is allowing us to create spaces for change. my fight song only one? i have a whole playlist! some of the english language ones are this time by tracy chapman, knight moves by suzanne vega, i gotta feeling by the black eye peas, who’s going to ride your wild horse by u2, bring it on by seal, hammer and a nail by the indigo girls, i’m still standing by elton john, kung fu fighting by carl douglas, hey you by pink floyd, can’t stop by red hot chili peppers, titanium by david guetta (featuring sia), over by jessica hernandez and the deltas secret weapon my optimism, my resourcefulness, my wonderful husband and son, the sun that comes out every morning no matter how shitty life in stem is, my techs, students, and postdocs that make it all worthwhile.. my worst moment having any control over what is said to me or about me. as long as no one touches me without my consent, it’s been a successful day in science. i’ve given up on that in constantly trying to figure out if the men i interact with intend for these interactions to be professional or more personal in nature, i’ve somehow lost my humanity in how i interact with people. i’m afraid what i’ve lost is my innocence, in that i used to believe that people were interested in me because my science is good – but i’m now aware that it’s “come for the looks, stay because i’m the ‘real deal’”. i’m tired of some of my strongest advocates telling me i’m sought after for tenure-track jobs because i’m a “qualified woman, and places are always looking for those”. and don’t get me started on the time i’ve spent deciding what to wear at meetings or trying to stop scratching my head while i’m thinking, which i’ve been told is flirtatious and gives the wrong impression. all of that time could have been put to much better use actually doing science. this has cost me i’m pretty good at standing up for myself, but i’m still not brave enough to tell the habitual offenders in my life how they affect me, instead of pretending that i don’t care. something you should know about me a really supportive science village.. to the attending who harassed me i’m sorry that we are in this position and thank you for meeting. i know that you met with hr already. i was told that you were “sufficiently remorseful they felt you wouldn’t do it again.” i’m sure you are sorry. however, what concerns me more is whether you understand what you did and why it’s not acceptable. the whole process of experiencing this and reporting it has made it to clear to me that even at a place like here so many people do not understand sexual harassment. i would like to share my perspective on this because this is the voice and perspective that is so often silenced via everything from violent retaliation to career hits and stigma.female physicians already have to rally every day for equal recognition in our jobs. when you repeatedly touched my leg and kissed me, you sent a signal that i’m not your colleague but something inferior. i am certain you would never grab a male resident kiss him. i am also certain you would not have kissed another attending demonstrating how these actions play on both the gender and attending-trainee power dynamics. those dynamics alone make these actions wrong. i was left feeling like some small play thing not the resident who was supposed to be the leader of the team. it was humiliating and belittling. it is one thing to hope for this from patients but it’s disheartening to have to hope for that equality in recognition from an established faculty member.even more fundamentally, your actions demonstrate a lack of respect for a woman’s autonomy given that it didn’t cross your mind that a woman might not perceive your actions with her body in the same way as you. my thigh is not available for your grabbing at will and my face nor any other resident’s is not available for your lips to do what you want.i want to be very clear; there is no construct of endearment, affection, or empathy, as has been suggested, that describes what you did. it was sexual harassment.and ultimately, there is how it left me feeling. maybe why i pushed so hard for something to be done before you went back on service, is the enormous effect your actions had on me and my fear they may do the same to someone else. sure, the frequent thigh grab was certainly uncomfortable. however, when you kissed me-it was a visceral feeling of sheer fear. and when you kept holding onto me after you kissed me and kept talking in my face, my mind was racing through what you were going to do next or what exactly was happening as i gritted my teeth and smiled back at you. this was followed by constant anxiety, frequent panic attacks, flashbacks and sleepless nights in tears over the next few hours, days, and weeks. your actions also opened old wounds i realized i never let heal. it wasn’t until this happened that i ever told anyone the full extent of the past. at first it was traumatizing but i’m learning to derive strength from having survived it. the last person who kissed me without consent then violently assaulted and tried to rape me. that is the fear your actions evoked; emotions of having your dignity and safety stripped away all at once. there is a key distinction between those events and these – he was a grad student without any power over me and i could eventually fight him back. you are in a position of power relative to residents and i never felt that i could ask you to stop grabbing my thigh or not kiss me. knowing someone’s past shouldn’t matter in deciding these actions were wrong. but i want you to realize that you never know what someone has been through nor do you need to. these two experiences have also shown me these behaviors are not reserved for just bars or drunk frat parties; academic institutions are not immune to this behavior.i am sure going to hr was not comfortable for you. what you may not realize is how hard i had to work to even get this to hr. sexual harassment and assault in many ways are a dual trauma-the pain of experiencing it and the re-traumatization of re-telling the story only to feel degraded, and alone over and over again. it took 6 meetings and phone calls on my end for a plan to be put in place. part of me regrets having reported it at all. i used to love our residency and my job but now i’ve lost so much trust of the established faculty because of what you did, because initially reporting this left me feeling even more isolated, and because here is where i was reminded of the worst night of my life. i’m sure being reminded of the past was something that was bound to happen. however, i hate that it happened here. for a while it took all my energy to show up here and keep from emotionally falling apart at work and i’m sure it will be a long journey pulling it back together.this may all seem hyperbolic in response to what really amounts to a few minutes of your actions. but it only takes a few seconds to minutes to harass or assault someone. that is how much power one has in this sphere-a few seconds to minutes of your action can cause significantly more pain. i don’t share all of this to chastise you and i am really sorry we are in this position. i share it because it’s a perspective that needs to be shared and i hope brings you greater understanding of this problem. i have given up on not yet. i’m afraid of damage to my reputation, repercussions from leadership and the attending i reported, of being further violated by people in positions of power or from people i thought i could trust, of the flashbacks and anxiety i face at work constantly. this has cost me an enormous amount of time in meetings, time spent dealing with my own emotions, money for therapy. is there a bright side i think reporting this has awoken people at my institution that is an issue that needs to be dealt with and understood better.. my worst moment thinking my husband would leave me because of what happened. feeling like i had nothing to live for. i have given up on assuming everyone is basically good and has good intentions. i missed a lot of red flags because i thought he was my mentor and “he couldn’t possibly mean it that way”. i’m afraid i was very lucky. i had short term disability which enabled me to be paid at 60% while i recovered. i had health insurance that covered part of my hospital stay, outpatient counseling and medication. my new job actually paid me more than the one i had to quit when i was assaulted. i would estimate i lost about $6k in wages and spent around $2k on my medical care, and other $2k in lawyers fees. however, i can’t put a price on my lost productivity and all the extra administrative labor related to my assault. this has cost me i make up silly sons to distract my son when he’s cranky 🙂 something you should know about me for me, i have become a passionate advocate of diversity and inclusion. i never attended a swe conference in undergrad, because i thought it was lame. now i actively seek out female-only conferences to network, recruit and champion women’s issues. i validate other women’s experiences when they confide in me. for women in stem as a whole, i do hope we can move forward to a better place. is there a bright side my amazing network of women friends and mentors.. i have given up on as a woman” janet declined to provide a photo i’m afraid after i was harassed, my family told me that it was my fault that i was harassed as a woman, i shouldn’t have entered the stem field; i shouldn’t be out there “competing with men”, but should instead marry a wealthy man to “complete me”. they told me that i should marry someone as quickly as possible now that i was “not pure” and “devalued”; and i should “think on the bright side” that someone was even willing to sexually harass me – that meant i was attractive enough as a woman. i have given up communicating with people, especially my family, that i was not the one at fault, and that the man who harassed me were not “men just being men”. this has cost me that the same thing will happen to me again, and that he will do the same thing to other women – he is still out there, not punished at all. i could not report him, because in my home country at that time, if i did, either no one would believe me, or everyone would just blame me for what he did or for not being “forgiving”. something you should know about me what happened was the reason i left my home country to attend grad school abroad – he is a well-known professor, and i cannot possibly pursue a career in chemistry without interacting with him. so basically, it had cost me all my academic career opportunities in chemistry back in my home country. it was tough to start my life all over, to learn to speak a foreign language, and to adjust to a new culture, but i survived, and at least now i can pursue my academic career in chemistry in a different country. is there a bright side? i am super resilient and persistent. also, despite what happened, i love my career and my life. i enjoy the moments of even the smallest achievements in my academic career, and i appreciate the cuteness of animals, the tastiness of food, the beauty of flowers…those are just a few examples of the many beautiful things i find in my career and my life, and i still think they far outweigh the negative. what’s your fight song? when experiencing trauma, i am generally able to pull myself together very quickly and keep a level head, so that i can focus on finding ways to get out of the traumatic conditions (in this case, going abroad for grad school).. my worst moment hard to pick one worst moment, but how i found out would be right up there. i’d noticed some discomfort when i peed. a few days later, i noted a discharge on the inside of my underwear. i went to my doctor, who said the symptoms were consistent with either chlamydia or gonorrhea. since one antibiotic could be used to treat both, i decided to forego having a swab shoved into my already-tender urethra, so i don’t actually know which it was. the bigger question was how i’d gotten it, because i’d only had sex with one person recently (or ever), and that was my partner, who’d been studying physics abroad for the last several months and had just come home for break. sitting on our bed, i told her about all of this, and she shattered right in front of me. through sobs, she told me about leaving a party drunk, walking home by herself…. what she couldn’t bring herself to tell me, she alluded to so that i understood. i’ve given up on i’ve given up on recapturing all aspects of the person i was before this. most of the time, i believe that most people are basically good. but, i also often feel that many men aren’t all that far away from dumb beasts. not all, or even most, but many. this has cost me it cost me that relationship, for sure, and maybe others. in the past, this has cost me sleepless nights from nightmares, uncountable liver and brain cells, and probably some other health effects yet to be seen. i’ve struggled to restore a semi-normal sex life. something you should know about me i’m a man in stem. my partner was a woman in stem. the costs to her and damage done are obvious, but know that the blast radius from events like this is huge, with lots of casualties. is there a bright side there is. i’ve made it through all of this. i love the person i am, and every experience i’ve had has contributed to who i am now. in some ways, i have been forged in fire. and i’m so much fucking tougher than anyone would guess. my fight song i have a few. i have an amazing partner now who has been and continues to be a vital source of healing. i have incredible friends and colleagues, some of whom know about this, most of whom don’t. these are the positives. my other secret weapon is that i’m a cis hetero man, so shitheads will say things in front of me thinking i’ll go along with “locker room talk.” i’m also very observant, so i notice everything. these days, i remember just about everything, too. i am very committed to justice, and i can be very, very patient.. my worst moment i was struggling with my work in a graduate program due to severe health issues. my advisor suggested i speak with a much older grad student for support. he was nice and helpful at first, but this soon turned into violation of boundaries and persistent sexual harassment. when i spoke to my advisor about it, she said she could not believe he would act that way, and that i must have misunderstood or invited that kind of treatment. i worked hard to avoid this person for as long as i could, but eventually, the stress it caused exacerbated my health problems so much that i ended up taking a medical leave of absence that lasted two years. along with my other health issues, i became deeply depressed, and frankly, i was scared to go back. he was gone by the time i returned, and i finished my requirements as quickly as possible. i will never forget that my advisor, who was another woman, didn’t believe me. that still hurts. i have given up on expecting anyone else to protect me, even if it’s their job to do so. no matter what anyone says, it’s clear that faculty members and other university representatives are primarily interested in preserving their reputations, pretending everything is fine, and protecting whichever party is more powerful, which is almost never the victim. i’m afraid that my career will be ruined if i ever have anything truly awful to report. i lost two years of my life that should have been very productive. this has cost me this is just one example out of many when i’ve been sexually harassed and/or received unwanted romantic overtures in an academic or laboratory setting.. my worst moment biophysics. i do biology now. i have given up on biophysics. of the horrible men in power. i’m afraid time. prestige. opportunities. this has cost me i’m an adamant feminist now. something you should know about me nope.. my worst moment when he persisted in stalking me even after he was warned that the police were aware of his behavior and that stalking was a felony crime in that jurisdiction. i have given up on nothing. i’m afraid that he is still harassing women. he’s an associate professor at the university of georgia. this has cost me probably not much. i ended up in a career that was much more satisfying and lucrative than staying in academia. something you should know about me i’m a fighter. and i’m a witch. really. i’ve been practicing feminist witchcraft since about 1984. is there a bright side i’m now working with scientific societies to end harassment at their meetings and conferences. my fight song “so ferocious” by carsie blanton [youtube link] secret weapon years of meditation practice.. my worst moment the first conference i attended as a grad student was held on a university campus. i arrived a little early, checked in for registration and headed over to the student union bar to see if anyone else for the meeting was congregating there. it wasn’t very busy at all and i was standing in a quiet corner wondering if to get a drink or leave when an older guy drinking a beer came over to me introducing himself as a professor from that university and asked if i was there for the meeting. i told him that i was and started to introduce myself. i have given up on “perhaps you’re not as horny as i am yet” and immediately pushed his hand against my stomach and down inside the front of my jeans and inside my underwear. i don’t know why i didn’t cry out, but i didn’t. instead, i wrenched away in horror and ran to the ladies bathrooms, acting purely on instinct. i’m afraid t being ok to be in a room alone with men that i don’t know really well. even though i now lead my own lab and have to attend many meetings with students, other professors, new colleagues etc. and have therefore been in the situation hundreds and hundreds of time, i still feel my heart rate go up and have difficulty concentrating if i can’t see a clear exit route. this has cost me that i will always feel so incredibly stupid for having such a long and ongoing negative reaction to an encounter that probably that lasted for less than two minutes in total and was in a fairly public place. it took me a really, really long time to accept that i didn’t do this (this life of fear and anxiety) to myself and, in dark moments, i still don’t really believe that. something you should know about me thousands in fees for private counseling. but i don’t resent those costs as much as i do the difficult-to-monetize opportunities i missed by avoiding events and situations when i knew i might feel threatened or may see this person again. i switched fields and this, together with my insecurities and anxieties, meant that i missed several opportunities that led to my career advancement lagging significantly, maybe 8 or 9 years, behind my peers. i eventually got myself together but, on starting my lab, i found that i was ineligible for several fellowships and grants that many people establish themselves with because i was too many years post-phd. unlike having had time-out to raise kids, i cannot explain in 250 words or less why this is or why i might deserve an exception. is there a bright side? i’m also not white. despite this single event being awful, it never made me think i should quit science. i know that most people in the community would never condone the awful actions of that individual. the moments that i think about quitting are always inspired by incessant low-level racist comments and statements of privilege and superiority by a surprising proportion of people. these make me wonder if our community is really as educated, evidence-driven and enlightened as it claims to be and if i really want to be a part of it. my fight song i’m ok with myself and who i am as a person! sure, i suffer from situation-triggered anxiety, but i’m kind and considerate to everyone at every level. i don’t claim credit when it belongs to someone else, i don’t steal other people’s ideas and i don’t bully or belittle students or anyone else. no matter how i’ve been treated, or how often i see others behaving in this way, i have not compromised on that. having made the decision to maintain my personal integrity, even if it means forfeiting a few scientific ‘wins’, makes me feel calmer and stronger. even if i don’t make tenure, or don’t keep achieve a lifetime career in science, at least i didn’t make moral compromises that i would live to regret. abusers, racists and bullies might gain some progress and a little power from their actions but, no matter what else they do, they will never be anything more than those labels. one day their behaviour will be known and rejected. as mlk said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice … and i have nothing to fear from it.'"
